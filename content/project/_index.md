The **Experimental Oceanography** group aims to advance our understanding of ocean dynamics and circulation in a changing climate.  We are a seagoing group, specialising in physical oceanographic measurements and using approaches that leverage traditional observations with new platforms and satellite data.  Using a range of observational platforms enables us to address problems spanning scales (from micro- to large-scale), and spanning spheres (from the ocean to biogeosphere, cryosphere and atmosphere).  We are driven by scientific curiosity, and motivated by problems with the potential to address societal needs.

## Ocean Circulation


### Active projects at IfM EO
- [Explaining and Predicting the Ocean Conveyor (EPOC)](../project/epoc/) - Horizon Europe consortium to understanding the AMOC, its connectivity, past and future
- [Denmark Strait Overflow transports](../project/dsow/) - observations of the overflow from Nordic Seas to North Atlantic through Denmark Strait (between Greenland and Iceland)
- [Targeted Experiment to Reconcile Increased Freshwater with Increased Convection (TERIFIC)](../project/terific/) - ERC fellowship with gliders and drifters in the Labrador Sea 

### Collaborative projects
- [Generation of the ocean's permanent pycnocline in the ice-covered Southern Ocean (PycnoGen)](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=EP%2FX025136%2F1) - under-ice moorings and gliders, fieldwork starting 2025/26
- [Resolving Biological carbon Export in the Labrador Sea (ReBELS)](https://gotw.nerc.ac.uk/list_split.asp?awardref=NE%2FV012797%2F1&cookieConsent=A) - biophysical interactions, fieldwork starting summer 2024
- [RAPID 26°N array](../project/rapid/) - observing the AMOC at 26°N using moorings

### Selected past projects (NOC and Univ. Southampton)

- [Mechanisms responsible for Mesoscale Eddy Energy Dissipation (MerMEED)](../project/mermeed) - understanding the local drivers of mesoscale eddy dissipation at the western boundary of the Atlantic.

- [Dynamics of the Orkney Passage Outflow (DynOPO)](../project/dynopo) - understanding drivers of outflow from the Weddell Sea to the wider Southern Ocean.
