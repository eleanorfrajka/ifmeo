## Synopsis

The dense overflows across the Greenland-Iceland-Scotland ridge constitute the most important contribution to the lower limb of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. Among those, the Denmark Strait carries with about half of the total the largest fraction of the transport. Since 1996, the outflow of DSOW has nearly constantly be monitored with moored instruments. The University Hamburg maintains an ADCP mooring at the Denmark Strait sill up to date.

The array is based on two upward-looking ADCPs with hydrographic sensors (blue dots) and a standard CTD section (red line). DS1 is located in the east and DS2 is located in the west.  

Volume transports of the overflow through Denmark Strait are captured by the two moored acoustic current profilers and hydrographic sensors at the DS1 and DS2 locations. DS1 is maintained by Hafrannsóknastofnun Marine and Freshwater Research Institute (MFRI), Iceland, and DS2 is maintained by Universität of Hamburg, Experimental Oceanography group. Processing of the data is described by Jochumsen et. al (2017).
