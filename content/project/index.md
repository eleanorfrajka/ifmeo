      text: 'The Experimental Oceanography group is part of the Earth System Sciences department at the Universität Hamburg. We  aim to advance our understanding of ocean dynamics and circulation in a changing climate. We are a seagoing group, specialising in physical oceanographic measurements and using approaches that leverage traditional observations with new platforms and satellite data.

      Topics include:

      - Large-scale ocean circulation including the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation and gyre circulations.

      - Small-scale processes, e.g. deep ocean convection, submesoscale mixing, and turbulent dissipation.

      - Measurement methods. Using in situ and remote sensing to better observe the ocean.'

## Research project: EPOC

[EPOC – Explaining and Predicting the Ocean Conveyor](http://epoc-eu.org) is a collaborative EU-funded research project aiming to improve understanding of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and its role in climate. The project brings together observational, modelling, and theoretical approaches to better quantify AMOC variability, its driving processes, and future evolution under climate change. EPOC supports coordinated European efforts to enhance climate prediction capabilities and inform policy-relevant assessments of ocean circulation changes.
