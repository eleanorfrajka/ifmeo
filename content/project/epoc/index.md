## Explaining and Predicting the Ocean Conveyor

**Project website:** http://epoc-eu.org


[EPOC â€“ Explaining and Predicting the Ocean Conveyor](http://epoc-eu.org) is a collaborative EU-funded research project aiming to improve understanding of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and its role in climate. The project brings together observational, modelling, and theoretical approaches to better quantify AMOC variability, its driving processes, and future evolution under climate change. EPOC supports coordinated European efforts to enhance climate prediction capabilities and inform policy-relevant assessments of ocean circulation changes.
