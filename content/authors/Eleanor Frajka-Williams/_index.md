# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am a physical oceanographer who uses ocean observations to investigate ocean dynamics and circulation in a changing climate. I have a particular interest in problems spanning scales (from micro- to large-scale) or spheres (biogeosphere, cryosphere, atmosphere), and in methods that leverage traditional observations with new platforms and satellite data.

interests:
  - Ocean dynamics in a changing climate
  - Observational methods and technology
