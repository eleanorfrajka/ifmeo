# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: My research focuses on understanding how the waters that originate from Greenland and the Arctic circulate in the Subpolar North Atlantic.  The fate of these relatively fresh waters is particularly important.  If they enter the deep convection regions of the Labrador, Irminger and Nordic Seas, they could increase the stratification in these regions. This could lead to a weakening of deep water formation and potentially affect the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. For this work, I primarily use in situ observations, in particular surface drifters, which are instruments that follow surface currents.
