# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am a physical oceanographer who uses ocean observations to investigate ocean dynamics and circulation in a changing climate. I have a particular interest in problems spanning scales (from micro- to large-scale) or spheres (biogeosphere, cryosphere, atmosphere), and in methods that leverage traditional observations with new platforms and satellite data.

I am a physical oceanographer who uses ocean observations to investigate ocean dynamics and circulation in a changing climate, and the leader of the Experimental Oceanography working group at the Institute of Oceanography, Universität Hamburg. I have a particular interest in problems spanning scales (from micro- to large-scale) or spheres (biogeosphere, cryosphere, atmosphere), and in methods that leverage traditional observations with new platforms and satellite data.
