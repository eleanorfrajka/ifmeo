# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: The Experimental Oceanography group aims to advance our understanding of ocean dynamics and circulation in a changing climate. We are a seagoing group, specialising in physical oceanographic measurements and using approaches that leverage traditional observations with new platforms and satellite data. Using a range of observational platforms enables us to address problems spanning scales (from micro- to large-scale), and spanning spheres (from the ocean to biogeosphere, cryosphere and atmosphere). We are driven by scientific curiosity, and motivated by problems with the potential to address societal needs.
