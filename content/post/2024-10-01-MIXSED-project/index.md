The AEI-DFG DS-MIXSED project (Denmark Strait - Mixing and Sediment Dynamics) will be starting in 2025 with collaborators [David Amblas](https://webgrec.ub.edu/webpages/000009/ang/damblas.ub.edu.html), [Anna Sanchez](https://webgrec.ub.edu/webpages/000009/ang/anna.sanchez.ub.edu.html), [Wilken-Jon von Appen](https://www.awi.de/en/about-us/organisation/staff/single-view/wilken-jon-von-appen.html) and [Lola Perez Hernandez](https://mdoloresperez.weebly.com).  This is a 3-year project to study mixing in the Denmark Strait overflow waters downstream of Denmark Strait, and the influence of currents on seabed morphology (and vice versa).  More information will be forthcoming in the new year.
