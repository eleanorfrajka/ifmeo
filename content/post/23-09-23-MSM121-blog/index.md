EPOC’s expedition to Flemish Cap and Grand Banks is underway! Sailing on the German research vessel RV Maria S. Merian, the team left Nuuk in Greenland and is heading south through the Labrador Sea to their first work area just north of Flemish Cap in the NW Atlantic – which lies about 560km east of Newfoundland.

This expedition – MSM121 – marks the start of EPOC’s 2-year field experiment to determine over what scales (time and space) large-scale ocean circulation works as a coherent pattern, and where atmospheric drivers and/or internal ocean processes cause that coherence to break down.
