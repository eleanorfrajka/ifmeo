The DFG project [PycnMIX](../project/pycnmix) has been approved for funding.  This is an exciting new project where we'll push the limits of observational capabilities of gliders--using under-ice navigation for Seagliders and a method to derive turbulent dissipation from standard gliders using the glider flight model.  This is a collaboration with Alberto Naveira Garabato (Univ Southampton) with sea trials starting in 2025 and the major field campaign in the Southern Ocean in 2026.
