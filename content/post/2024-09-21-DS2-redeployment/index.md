The DS2 mooring was successfully redeployed in the Denmark Strait by Andreas and Chiara onboard the Sarmiento de Gamboa.  The Denmark Strait mooring array is maintained by us and [Andreas Macrander](https://www.hafogvatn.is/is/midlun/utgafa/authors/andreas-macrander) at the Marine & Freshwater Research Institute of Iceland.
