abstract: 'It is debated that mesoscale reverse tip jets caused by distortion between atmospheric flow and
Greenland contribute to wintertime deep convection in the southeast Labrador Sea. Synoptic
scale westerlies from the Canadian continent are argued to have greater cooling influence than
reverse tip jets at this site. Quantification of air-sea interactions between reverse tip jets,
westerlies and the southeast Labrador Sea will provide vital information on the ability for these
wind phenomena to contribute to global ocean circulation. Using QuikSCAT satellite wind
data, reverse tip jets and westerlies have been objectively identified for seven winters (October
to April) from 2002-2009. Composite analysis determines the surface heat fluxes and air-sea
temperature differences associated with the wind events, through use of the European Centre
for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ERA-Interim reanalysis data. Over the southeast
Labrador Sea both reverse tip jets and westerlies have average wind speeds up to 30 m s-1
.
However, reverse tip jets are determined to have low associated ocean-atmosphere heat fluxes
no more than -150 W m-2, whilst westerlies drive greater cooling with heat fluxes up to -720
W m-2 over single events. Associated atmospheric temperatures are the primary influence on
negative heat flux magnitudes, not wind speed, with total wintertime heat fluxes correlating
significantly to the mean winter air-sea temperature differences (r = -0.82). Westerly air
temperatures originating from the Canadian continent are as cold as -9.7 °C, whilst air
temperatures associated with reverse tip jets originating over relatively warm oceans are no
cooler than -1.1 °C. Interannual variations are seen in winter heat fluxes and temperatures,
largely from the influence of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Due to low associated heat
fluxes, reverse tip jets are an insignificant influence on deep convection in the southeast
Labrador Sea. However, westerlies with favourable atmospheric conditions (positive NAO)
drive strong ocean-atmosphere heat fluxes with potential to influence convective activity in the
southeast Labrador Sea.
