  caption: 'Average meridional velocity from 16 Lowered Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler sections collected between 2005 and 2015. Positive values indicate northward flow; the zero contours are indicated by the bold white lines. Lowered Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler profiles were collected at the same nominal locations (black dots along lower axis) during each cruise section. Gray shading indicates the bottom topography within the upper 2,000 dbar. Vertical dash‐dot lines and the labels A, A2, B, and C above indicate the locations of the Pressure‐equipped Inverted Echo Sounder moorings; vertical dotted line and the GCM label indicates the nominal midpoint location of the moorings inshore of site A where the gridded current meter velocities are centered.'
