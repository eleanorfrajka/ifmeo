abstract: The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) is a key component
  of the ocean circulation system that is constantly moving water, heat, salt, carbon,
  nutrients, and other substances around the globe. The AMOC impacts the Atlantic
  Ocean in a unique way, making it the only ocean basin where heat is carried northward
  in both hemispheres.
