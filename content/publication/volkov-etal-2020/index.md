abstract: "The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) is a key component of the ocean circu-
lation system that is constantly moving water, heat, salt, carbon, nutrients, and other substances
around the globe. The AMOC impacts the Atlantic Ocean in a unique way, making it the only
ocean basin where heat is carried northward in both hemispheres. Recognizing the role of the
AMOC in Earth’'s climate and, hence, the importance of monitoring and understanding it, several
AMOC-observing systems have been established over the last two decades (e.g., Frajka-Williams
et al. 2019; McCarthy et al. 2020; Fig. 3.20). This section describes the most recent findings derived
from the existing observations of the volume (MOC) and the associated meridional heat transports
(MHT). Because some of the key boundary current arrays have been observed for longer than the
fully trans-basin arrays, key results on those boundary currents are also reviewed."

Estimates of the northward MOC and MHT transports: (a)
across OSNAP array, (b) at 26.5°N, and (c) at 34.5°S. Gray curves show
12-hourly values for RAPID/MOCHA/WBTS in (b) and daily values for
SAMBA in (c); black curves show MOC monthly values. The blue lines
show averages during 2004–08 and 2008–12 in panel (b) and linear
trends in 2009–10 and 2013–17 in panel (c). MHT estimates are shown
by red curves for OSNAP and RAPID/MOCHA/WBTS arrays. The green
curve in (b) shows the MOC estimate at 26.5°N from the combination
of altimetry and Argo data. The blue/red crosses in (c) show MOC/
MHT estimates obtained from XBT data along AX18 transect in the
South Atlantic.
