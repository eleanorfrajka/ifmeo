abstract: Mesoscale eddies contain the bulk of the ocean’s kinetic energy (KE), but
  fundamental questions remain on the cross-scale KE transfers linking eddy generation
  and dissipation. The role of submesoscale flows represents the key point of discussion,
  with contrasting views of submesoscales as either a source or a sink of mesoscale
  KE. Here, the first observational assessment of the annual cycle of the KE transfer
  between mesoscale and submesoscale motions is performed in the upper layers of a
  typical open-ocean region. Although these diagnostics have marginal statistical
  significance and should be regarded cautiously, they are physically plausible and
  can provide a valuable benchmark for model evaluation. The cross-scale KE transfer
  exhibits two distinct stages, whereby submesoscales energize mesoscales in winter
  and drain mesoscales in spring. Despite this seasonal reversal, an inverse KE cascade
  operates throughout the year across much of the mesoscale range. Our results are
  not incompatible with recent modeling investigations that place the headwaters of
  the inverse KE cascade at the submesoscale, and that rationalize the seasonality
  of mesoscale KE as an inverse cascade-mediated response to the generation of submesoscales
  in winter. However, our findings may challenge those investigations by suggesting
  that, in spring, a downscale KE transfer could dampen the inverse KE cascade. An
  exploratory appraisal of the dynamics governing mesoscale–submesoscale KE exchanges
  suggests that the upscale KE transfer in winter is underpinned by mixed layer baroclinic
  instabilities, and that the downscale KE transfer in spring is associated with frontogenesis.
  Current submesoscale-permitting ocean models may substantially understate this downscale
  KE transfer, due to the models’ muted representation of frontogenesis.
