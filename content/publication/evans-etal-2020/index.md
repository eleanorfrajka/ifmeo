abstract: Mesoscale eddies are ubiquitous dynamical features that tend to propagate
  westward and disappear along ocean western boundaries. Using a multiscale observational
  study, we assess the extent to which eddies dissipate via a direct cascade of energy
  at a western boundary. We analyze data from a ship-based microstructure and velocity
  survey, and an 18-month mooring deployment, to document the dissipation of energy
  in anticyclonic and cyclonic eddies impinging on the topographic slope east of the
  Bahamas, in the North Atlantic Ocean. These observations reveal high levels of turbulence
  where the steep and rough topographic slope modified the intensified northward flow
  associated with, in particular, anticyclonic eddies. Elevated dissipation was observed
  both near-bottom and at mid depths (200â€“800 m). Near-bottom turbulence occurred
  in the lee of a protruding escarpment, where elevated Froude numbers suggest hydraulic
  control. Energy was also radiated in the form of upward-propagating internal waves.
  Elevated dissipation at mid depths occurred in regions of strong vertical shear,
  where the topographic slope modified the vertical structure of the northward eddy
  flow. Here, low Richardson numbers and a local change in the isopycnal gradient
  of potential vorticity (PV) suggest that the elevated dissipation was associated
  with horizontal shear instability. Elevated mid-depth dissipation was also induced
  by topographic steering of the flow. This led to large anticyclonic vorticity and
  negative PV adjacent to the topographic slope, suggesting that centrifugal instability
  underpinned the local enhancement in dissipation. Our results provide a mechanistic
  benchmark for the realistic representation of eddy dissipation in ocean models.
