abstract: The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) plays a key role
  in the global climate system through its redistribution of heat. Changes in the
  AMOC have been associated with large fluctuations in the earth’s climate in the
  past and projections of AMOC decline in the future due to climate change motivate
  the continuous monitoring of the circulation. Since 2004, the RAPID monitoring array
  has been providing continuous estimates of the AMOC and associated heat transport
  at 26°N in the North Atlantic. We describe how these measurements are made including
  the sampling strategy, the accuracies of parameters measured and the calculation
  of the AMOC. The strength of the AMOC and meridional heat transport are estimated
  as 17.2 Sv and 1.25 PW respectively from April 2004 to October 2012. The accuracy
  of ten day (annual) transports is 1.5 Sv (0.9 Sv). Improvements to the estimation
  of the transport above the shallowest instruments and deepest transports (including
  Antarctic Bottom Water), and the use of the new equation of state for seawater have
  reduced the estimated strength of the AMOC by 0.6 Sv relative to previous publications.
  As new basinwide AMOC monitoring projects begin in the South Atlantic and sub-polar
  North Atlantic, we present this thorough review of the methods and measurements
  of the original AMOC monitoring array.
