abstract: The strength of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) at
  26∘ N has now been continuously measured by the RAPID array over the period April
  2004–September 2018. This record provides unique insight into the variability of
  the large-scale ocean circulation, previously only measured by sporadic snapshots
  of basin-wide transport from hydrographic sections. The continuous measurements
  have unveiled striking variability on timescales of days to a decade, driven largely
  by wind forcing, contrasting with previous expectations about a slowly varying buoyancy-forced
  large-scale ocean circulation. However, these measurements were primarily observed
  during a warm state of the Atlantic multidecadal variability (AMV) which has been
  steadily declining since a peak in 2008–2010. In 2013–2015, a period of strong buoyancy
  forcing by the atmosphere drove intense water-mass transformation in the subpolar
  North Atlantic and provides a unique opportunity to investigate the response of
  the large-scale ocean circulation to buoyancy forcing. Modelling studies suggest
  that the AMOC in the subtropics responds to such events with an increase in overturning
  transport, after a lag of 3–9 years. At 45°N, observations suggest that the AMOC
  may already be increasing. Examining 26°N, we find that the AMOC is no longer weakening,
  though the recent transport is not above the long-term mean. Extending the record
  backwards in time at 26°N with ocean reanalysis from GloSea5, the transport fluctuations
  at 26° N are consistent with a 0- to 2-year lag from those at 45°N, albeit with
  lower magnitude. Given the short span of time and anticipated delays in the signal
  from the subpolar to subtropical gyres, it is not yet possible to determine whether
  the subtropical AMOC strength is recovering nor how the AMOC at 26°N responds to
  intense buoyancy forcing.
