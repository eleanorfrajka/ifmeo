abstract: The meridional overturning circulation (MOC) at  inline image in the Atlantic
  has a standard deviation of 4.9 Sv and contains large fluctuations at subannual
  periods. The geostrophic component of the MOC is believed to be influenced on subannual
  time scales by eddies and Rossby waves. To quantify this effect, the vertical structure
  and surface characteristics of westward propagating signals are studied using altimetric
  data and full-depth mooring measurements from the RAPID array at  inline image.
  Westward propagating features are observed in the western North Atlantic in both
  data sets and have periods of 80–250 days in the first baroclinic mode. These features
  are still observed by the RAPID moorings 20 km offshore of the western boundary.
  The western boundary also exhibits deep variability characterized by enhanced energy
  in higher baroclinic modes. The effect of eddies and Rossby waves on the geostrophic
  transport is quantified by representing their vertical structure with the first
  baroclinic mode. In total, 42% of the variance of the transbasin thermocline transport
  inferred from geostrophic calculations at  inline image can be attributed to first
  mode variability, which is associated with eddies and Rossby waves at periods of
  80–250 days. The standard deviation of the transbasin thermocline transport due
  to eddies and Rossby waves is estimated to be 2.6 Sv.
