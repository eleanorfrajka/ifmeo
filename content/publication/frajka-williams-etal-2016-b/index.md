  caption: 'Overturning transport anomalies at 26째N and 41째N after removing Ekman trans- ports. At 41째N, transports are estimated using Argo and altimetry (black line) and altimetry only (dashed gray line). At 26째N, transports are estimated from the RAPID array (solid red line) and altimetry (dashed pink line). The blue line shows the density anomaly integrated in the Labrador Sea between 1,000 m and 2,500 m from Robson et al. (2014), and the dashed blue line shows that anomaly estimated from Argo over 1,000 m to 2,000 m, then scaled by 3/2. The x-axis on the two plots is offset by 10 years to show a possible lagged response of transports to density changes.'

abstract: More than a decade of observations of the meridional overturning circulation
  in the subtropical North Atlantic show it to be highly variable on time scales of
  days to years and with an overall trend toward slowing down. Over the same time
  period, melting from Greenland (and elsewhere in the Arctic, including from sea
  ice) has been increasing, resulting in greater freshwater input to the northern
  North Atlantic. In this article, we examine evidence for the impact, if any, of
  this influx of freshwater on the large-scale ocean circulation and for potential
  changes.
