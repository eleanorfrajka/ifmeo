abstract: More than a decade of observations of the meridional overturning circulation
  in the subtropical North Atlantic show it to be highly variable on time scales of
  days to years and with an overall trend toward slowing down. Over the same time
  period, melting from Greenland (and elsewhere in the Arctic, including from sea
  ice) has been increasing, resulting in greater freshwater input to the northern
  North Atlantic. In this article, we examine evidence for the impact, if any, of
  this influx of freshwater on the large-scale ocean circulation and for potential
  changes.
