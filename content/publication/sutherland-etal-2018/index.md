abstract: The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) has been observed
  continuously at 26° N since April 2004. The AMOC and its component parts are monitored
  by combining a transatlantic array of moored instruments with submarine-cable-based
  measurements of the Gulf Stream and satellite derived Ekman transport. The time
  series has recently been extended to October 2012 and the results show a downward
  trend since 2004. From April 2008 to March 2012, the AMOC was an average of 2.7
  Sv (1 Sv = 106 m3 s−1) weaker than in the first four years of observation (95% confidence
  that the reduction is 0.3 Sv or more). Ekman transport reduced by about 0.2 Sv and
  the Gulf Stream by 0.5 Sv but most of the change (2.0 Sv) is due to the mid-ocean
  geostrophic flow. The change of the mid-ocean geostrophic flow represents a strengthening
  of the southward flow above the thermocline. The increased southward flow of warm
  waters is balanced by a decrease in the southward flow of lower North Atlantic deep
  water below 3000 m. The transport of lower North Atlantic deep water slowed by 7%
  per year (95% confidence that the rate of slowing is greater than 2.5% per year).
