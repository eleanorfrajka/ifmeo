abstract: Vertical velocities in the world’s oceans are typically small, less than
  1 cm s−1, posing a significant challenge for observational techniques. Seaglider,
  an autonomous profiling instrument, can be used to estimate vertical water velocity
  in the ocean. Using a Seaglider’s flight model and pressure observations, vertical
  water velocities are estimated along glider trajectories in the Labrador Sea before,
  during, and after deep convection. Results indicate that vertical velocities in
  the stratified ocean agree with the theoretical Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin (WKB)
  scaling of w; and in the turbulent mixed layer, scale with buoyancy, and wind forcing.
  It is estimated that accuracy is to within 0.5 cm s−1. Because of uncertainties
  in the flight model, velocities are poor near the surface and deep apogees, and
  during extended roll maneuvers. Some of this may be improved by using a dynamic
  flight model permitting acceleration and by better constraining flight parameters
  through pilot choices during the mission.
