abstract: This chapter gives an overview of recent advances in in situ
  observations of ocean mixing. It starts by providing a brief history of
  measuring ocean mixing. It then describes adaptations of traditional
  measurements and methods to autonomous platforms, including profiling floats
  and autonomous underwater vehicles. For each approach, the method is described
  as well as its limitations. Evidence for successful application of each method
  is provided.
