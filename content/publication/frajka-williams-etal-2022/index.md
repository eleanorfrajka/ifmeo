abstract: This chapter gives an overview of recent advances in in situ observations
  of ocean mixing. It starts by providing a brief history of measuring ocean mixing.
  It then describes adaptations of traditional measurements and methods to autonomous
  platforms, including profiling floats and autonomous underwater vehicles. For each
  approach, the method is described as well as its limitations. Evidence for successful
  application of each method is provided.
