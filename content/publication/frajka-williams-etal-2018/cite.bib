 abstract = {The meridional overturning circulation (MOC) has been measured by boundary arrays in
the Atlantic since 2000. Over the past decade of measurements, however, the reported tendencies
in overturning circulation strength have differed between 16N and 26N. Here,
we investigate these differences by diagnosing their origin in the observed hydrography,
finding that both arrays show deep waters (below 1100 dbar) at the western boundary becoming
fresher and less dense. The associated change in geopotential thickness is about
0.15 m2/s2 between 2004-2009 and 2010-2014, with the shift occurring between 2009-
2010 and earlier at 26N than 16N. In the absence of a similar density change on the east
of the Atlantic, this mid-depth reduction in water density at the west would drive an increase
in the shear between the upper and lower layers of North Atlantic Deep Water of
about 2.6 Sv at 26N and 3.9 Sv at 16N. These transport anomalies result in an intensifying
tendency in the MOC estimate at 16N, but at 26N, the method of correcting the
geostrophic reference level results in an opposing (reducing) tendency of the MOC. The
results indicate that both arrays are observing coherent, low frequency changes, but that
there remain discrepancies in the methods of addressing the geostrophic reference level for
boundary arrays measuring ocean circulation.},
