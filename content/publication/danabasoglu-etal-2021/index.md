abstract: Reference level assumptions used to calculate the Atlantic meridional overturning
  circulation transports at the RAPID and Meridional Overturning Variability Experiment
  (MOVE) observing arrays are revisited in an eddying ocean model. Observational transport
  calculation methods are complemented by several alternative approaches. At RAPID,
  the model transports from the observational method and the model truth (based on
  the actual model velocities) agree well in their mean and variability. There are
  substantial differences among the transport estimates obtained with various methods
  at the MOVE site. These differences result from relatively large and time-varying
  reference velocities at depth in the model, not supporting a level-of-no-motion.
  The methods that account for these reference velocities properly at MOVE produce
  transports that are in good agreement with the model truth. In contrast with the
  observational estimates, the model transport trends at MOVE and RAPID largely agree
  with each other on pentadal to multi-decadal time scales.
