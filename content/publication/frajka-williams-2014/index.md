abstract: Sustained observations of ocean properties reveal a global warming trend
  and rising sea levels. These changes have been documented by traditional ship-based
  measurements of ocean properties, whereas more recent Argo profiling floats and
  satellite records permit estimates of ocean changes on a near real-time basis. Through
  these and newer methods of observing the oceans, scientists are moving from quantifying
  the ‘state of the ocean’ to monitoring its variability, and distinguishing the physical
  processes bringing signals of change. In this paper, I give a brief overview of
  the UK contributions to the physical oceanographic observations, and the role they
  have played in the wider global observing systems. While temperature and salinity
  are the primary measurements of physical oceanography, new transbasin mooring arrays
  also resolve changes in ocean circulation on daily timescales. Emerging technologies
  permit routine observations at higher-than-ever spatial resolutions. Following this,
  I then give a personal perspective on the future of sustained observations. New
  measurement techniques promise exciting discoveries concerning the role of smaller
  scales and boundary processes in setting the large-scale ocean circulation and the
  ocean's role in climate. The challenges now facing the scientific community include
  sustaining critical observations in the case of funding system changes or shifts
  in government priorities. These long records will enable a determination of the
  role and response of the ocean to climate change.
