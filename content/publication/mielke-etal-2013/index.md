abstract: ' Time series of the observational estimate of the Atlantic meridional overturning
  circulation (AMOC) have recently become available, but so far, no contemporaneous
  relation has been documented between them. Here, we analyze the variability of the
  26°N Rapid Climate Change programme (RAPID) and the 41°N Argo-based AMOC estimates
  on seasonal timescales, and we compare them to a simulation from a high-resolution
  National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)-forced ocean model. In our
  analysis of the observed time series, we find that the seasonal cycles of the non-Ekman
  component of the AMOC between 26°N and 41°N are 180-degrees out-of-phase. Removing
  the mean seasonal cycle from each time series, the residuals have a non-stationary
  covariability. Our results demonstrate that the AMOC is meridionally covariable
  between 26°N and 41°N at seasonal timescales. We find the same covariability in
  the model, although the phasing differs from the observed phasing. This may offer
  the possibility of inferring AMOC variations and associated climate anomalies throughout
  the North Atlantic from discontinuous observations.'
