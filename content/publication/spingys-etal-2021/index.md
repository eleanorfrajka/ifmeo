abstract: 'Water-mass transformation by turbulent mixing is a key part of the deep-ocean
  overturning, as it drives the upwelling of dense waters formed at high latitudes.
  Here, we quantify this transformation and its underpinning processes in a small
  Southern Ocean basin: the Orkney Deep. Observations reveal a focusing of the transport
  in density space as a deep western boundary current (DWBC) flows through the region,
  associated with lightening and densification of the current’s denser and lighter
  layers, respectively. These transformations are driven by vigorous turbulent mixing.
  Comparing this transformation with measurements of the rate of turbulent kinetic
  energy dissipation indicates that, within the DWBC, turbulence operates with a high
  mixing efficiency, characterized by a dissipation ratio of 0.6 to 1 that exceeds
  the common value of 0.2. This result is corroborated by estimates of the dissipation
  ratio from microstructure observations. The causes of the transformation are unraveled
  through a decomposition into contributions dependent on the gradients in density
  space of the: dianeutral mixing rate, isoneutral area, and stratification. The transformation
  is found to be primarily driven by strong turbulence acting on an abrupt transition
  from the weakly stratified bottom boundary layer to well-stratified off-boundary
  waters. The reduced boundary layer stratification is generated by a downslope Ekman
  flow associated with the DWBC’s flow along sloping topography, and is further regulated
  by submesoscale instabilities acting to restratify near-boundary waters. Our results
  provide observational evidence endorsing the importance of near-boundary mixing
  processes to deep-ocean overturning, and highlight the role of DWBCs as hot spots
  of dianeutral upwelling.'
