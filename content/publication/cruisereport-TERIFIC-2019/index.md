abstract: "The purpose of the fieldwork activities detailed in this report was to deploy a range of autonomous platforms to measure physical oceanographic properties at the west Greenland margin and Labrador Sea. The land-based fieldwork spanned the dates in this report, while the seagoing activities were accomplished with 1 day of work onboard the Adolf Jensen, a 30m Greenlandic vessel. The autonomous platforms used included: two Seagliders (sg602 and sg638) equipped with CTDs, oxygen and biooptics (WETlabs triple puck); an autonomous surface vehicle (Sailbuoy Artemis) measuring surface temperature and salinity, surface wind speed and direction and air temperature, and a wave sensor; 50 standard Global Drifter Program drifters measuring temperature and their position; and 3 drifters measuring surface temperature and salinity sensors and barometric pressure. The drifters were deployed at the continental shelf edge offshore of Qaqortoq, Greenland on December 4. The gliders and autonomous surface vehicle were deployed on the shelf and transited offshore to the central Labrador Sea."
