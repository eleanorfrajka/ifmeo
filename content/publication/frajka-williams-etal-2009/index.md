abstract: 'We investigated the 2005 spring phytoplankton bloom in the Labrador Sea
  using Seaglider, an autonomous underwater vehicle equipped with hydrographic, bio-optical
  and oxygen sensors. The Labrador Sea blooms in distinct phases, two of which were
  observed by Seaglider: the north bloom and the central Labrador Sea bloom. The dominant
  north bloom and subsequent zooplankton growth are enabled by the advection of low-salinity
  water from West Greenland in the strong and eddy-rich separation of the boundary
  current. The glider observed high fluorescence and oxygen supersaturation within
  haline-stratified eddy-like features; higher fluorescence was observed at the edges
  than centers of the eddies. In the central Labrador Sea, the bloom occurred in thermally
  stratified water. Two regions with elevated subsurface chlorophyll were also observed:
  a 5 m thin-layer in the southwest Labrador Current, and in the Labrador shelf-break
  front. The thin layer observations were consistent with vertical shearing of an
  initially thicker chlorophyll patch. Observations at the front showed high fluorescence
  down to 100 m depth and aligned with the isopycnals defining the front. The high-resolution
  Seaglider sampling across the entire Labrador Sea provides first estimates of the
  scale dependence of coincident biological and physical variables.'
