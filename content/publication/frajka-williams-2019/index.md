abstract: 'This is a article on flow over topography named “Topographic eddies”. It covers the theory behind flow interactions with topography including islands, headlands and capes, sills and seamounts, as well as observational investigations of the same, and their influence on biology.'

Fig. 1. Examples of varying topography including a sloping ridge, subsurface ridge and headland. Here the H and L indicate regions of high and low pressure, respectively. In the ridge case (lower left), isopycnals are dashed indicating the presence of lee waves. In the headland case (lower right), a lee eddy is shown to the right of the topography. In the sloping ridge (top), a combination of both processes is occurring.
