abstract: In the 1990s, the subpolar gyre warmed, contracted westward and weakened, as evidenced by changes in maps of the subpolar sea surface height (SSH) anomalies [H ̈akkinen and Rhines, 2004, H ́atu ́n et al., 2005, H ̈akkinen and Rhines, 2009]. This period followed the Labrador Sea deep convection years ending in 1994, and corresponds to a restratifying period across the deep Labrador Sea, with waters below 1000 m becoming warmer, saltier and lighter [Lozier et al., 2010]. Here, we revisit the gyre index from altimetry and show that over 2013–2015, the North Atlantic subpolar gyre has been intensifying and expanding eastward, associated with the return of deep convection in the Labrador and Irminger Seas [Yashayaev and Loder, 2016, de Jong and de Steur, 2016]. Comparing SSH anomalies to dynamic thickness anomalies (∆D) from objectively mapped hydrographic data, we find that the SSH anomaly used for the gyre index at 57◦N, 52◦W corresponds most closely to the dynamic thickness anomalies between 700–2500 m. Using a 50-year record of ∆D, we show that periods of a stronger gyre correspond to periods of deep convection associated with persistent positive North Atlantic Oscillation conditions. Based on this evidence, and the recent return of deep convection, we speculate that the strength of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, recently in decline [Smeed et al., 2014], will soon recover.
