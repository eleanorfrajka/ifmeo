abstract: We investigated the variability of the spring phytoplankton bloom in the
  Labrador Sea, dividing into distinct biogeographical zones, then analyzing the relationship
  between the bloom and physical forcings. The spring phytoplankton bloom in the north
  Labrador Sea varied in intensity by a factor of 4 and in timing of onset by 3 weeks
  over the 11-year record from SeaWiFS satellite ocean chlorophyll, 1998–2008. This
  north bloom (north of 60 °N and west of the Labrador shelves) is earliest and most
  intense, owing in part to the offshore-directed freshwater stratification from the
  West Greenland Current. On interannual timescales, significant correlations were
  found between the north bloom intensity and ocean processes, namely offshore advection,
  eddy activity and runoff from Greenland. In contrast, the central Labrador Sea is
  later and weaker, and only a correlation between the bloom timing and irradiance
  was found. As the subpolar gyre shifts in strength and shape, freshwater outflow
  from the Arctic and Greenland changes, we may expect further changes in the biological
  response as indicated by these relationships.
