abstract: Despite the major role played by mesoscale eddies in redistributing the
  energy of the large-scale circulation, our understanding of their dissipation is
  still incomplete. This study investigates the generation of internal waves by decaying
  eddies in the North Atlantic western boundary. The eddy presence and decay are measured
  from the altimetric surface relative vorticity associated with an array of full-depth
  current meters extending ~100 km offshore at 26.5°N. In addition, internal waves
  are analyzed over a topographic rise from 2-yr high-frequency measurements of an
  acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP), which is located 13 km offshore in 600-m
  deep water. Despite an apparent polarity independence of the eddy decay observed
  from altimetric data, the flow in the deepest 100 m is enhanced for anticyclones
  (25.2 cm/s) compared with cyclones (−4.7 cm/s). Accordingly, the internal wave field
  is sensitive to this polarity-dependent deep velocity. This is apparent from the
  eddy-modulated enhanced dissipation rate, which is obtained from a finescale parameterization
  and exceeds 10e-9 W/kg for near-bottom flows greater than 8 cm/s. The present study
  underlines the importance of oceanic western boundaries for removing the energy
  of low-mode westward-propagating eddies to higher-mode internal waves.
