abstract: The Labrador Sea is a fascinating and difficult environment in which to
  work. In the winter, wind speeds can gust upwards of 200 km/hr, while 10-m wave
  heights and below freezing temperatures (-20°C) are not unheard off, making it an
  inhospitable area for field work. Indeed, few ships are present in the Labrador
  Sea during the winter. However, the same harsh conditions have made the Labrador
  Sea a key region for Earth’s climate, with the wintertime conditions resulting in
  localized deep mixing of waters and carbon to great depths (2 km) in the ocean [Lazier,
  1980; Pickart, 1997]. As a consequence, in-situ observations in the Labrador Sea
  are critical to advancing scientific knowledge on past and future climate change
  scenarios. Previous attempts to use ships for wintertime work required long expeditions
  at sea, but often with little data collected due to unworkable conditions. Autonomous
  marine vehicles provide an obvious solution to collecting in-situ data in the wintertime,
  as they can operate in extreme conditions yet still give us the flexibility to adapt
  our sampling during the mission [deYoung et al., 2018; Testor et al., 2019].
