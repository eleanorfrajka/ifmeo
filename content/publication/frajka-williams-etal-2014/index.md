between the surface and 700 m, marked as a vertical bar for (a) sg015 and (b) sg014. Anomalies are calculated relative
to u 5 3.58C, S 5 34.85, and s1 5 32.33 kg m23. Positive anomalies are less dense. Small std devs indicate a high degree 0

abstract: Deep convection—the process by which surface waters are mixed down to 1000
  m or deeper—forms the primary downwelling of the meridional overturning circulation
  in the Northern Hemisphere. High-resolution hydrographic measurements from Seagliders
  indicate that during deep convection—though water is well mixed vertically—there
  is substantial horizontal variation in density over short distances (tens of kilometers).
  This horizontal density variability present in winter (January–February) contains
  sufficient buoyancy to restratify the convecting region to observed levels 2.5 months
  later, as estimated from Argo floating platforms. These results highlight the importance
  of small-scale heterogeneities in the ocean that are typically poorly represented
  in climate models, potentially contributing to the difficulty climate models have
  in representing deep convection.
