title: Annual cycle of turbulence estimated from Seagliders
subtitle: ''
summary: 'Updated methods to estimate turbulence from Seagliders (originally from Beaird et al. 2012), with a demonstration in the northeast Atlantic.  The primary addition is to filter by local stratification as observed by the Seaglider.  When N is large, this filter should isolate turbulent processes within the inertial subrange. When N is very low, within the surface mixed layer for example, this filtering acts to remove the mean and any trend with respect to depth from the vertical velocity.'
