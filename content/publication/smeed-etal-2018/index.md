abstract: The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is responsible for
  a variable and climatically important northward transport of heat. Using data from
  an array of instruments that span theAtlantic at 26N, we show that the AMOC has
  been in a state of reduced overturning since 2008 as compared to 2004--2008. This
  change of AMOC state is concurrent with other changes in the North Atlantic such
  as a northward shift and broadening of the Gulf Stream and altered patterns of heat
  content and sea surface temperature. These changes resemble the response to a declining
  AMOC predicted by coupled climate models. Concurrent changes in air-sea fluxes close
  to the western boundary reveal that the changes in ocean heat transport and sea
  surface temperature have altered the pattern of ocean-atmosphere heat exchange over
  the North Atlantic. These results provide strong observational evidence that the
  AMOC is a major factor in decadal-scale variability of North Atlantic climate
