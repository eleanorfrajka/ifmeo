abstract: 'The linkages between the space-time variability of observed clouds, rainfall,
  large-circulation patterns and topography in northern India and the Himalayas were
  investigated using remote sensing data. The research purpose was to test the hypothesis
  that cloudiness patterns are dynamic tracers of rainstorms, and therefore their
  temporal and spatial evolution can be used as a proxy of the spatial and temporal
  organization of precipitation and precipitation processes in the Himalayan range
  during the monsoon. The results suggest that the space-time distribution of precipitation,
  the spatial variability of the diurnal cycle of convective activity, and the terrain
  (landform and altitudinal gradients) are intertwined at spatial scales ranging from
  the order of a few kms (1–5km) up to the continental-scale. Furthermore, this relationship
  is equally strong in the time domain with respect to the onset and intra-seasonal
  variability of the monsoon. Infrared and microwave imagery of cloud fields were
  analyzed to characterize the spatial and temporal evolution of mesoscale convective
  weather systems and short-lived convection in Northern India, the Himalayan range,
  and in the Tibetan Plateau during three monsoon seasons (1999, 2000 and 2001). The
  life cycle of convective systems suggests landform and orographic controls consistent
  with a convergence zone constrained to the valley of the Ganges and the Himalayan
  range, bounded in the west by the Aravalli range and the Garhwal mountains and in
  the East by the Khasi Hills and the Bay of Bengal, which we call the Northern India
  Convergence Zone (NICZ). The NICZ exhibits strong night-time activity along the
  south-facing slopes of the Himalayan range, which is characterized by the development
  of short-lived convection (1–3h) aligned with protruding ridges between 1:00 and
  3:00 AM. The intra-annual and inter-annual variability of convective activity in
  the NICZ were assessed with respect to large-scale synoptic conditions, monsoon
  activity in the Bay of Bengal, and the modulating role of orography. Empirical orthogonal
  function (EOF) and canonical correlation (CC) analysis suggest that joint modes
  of variability of monsoon weather and topography, which we call orographic land-atmosphere
  interactions, modulate the space-time variability of cloudiness in the region. Finally,
  scaling analysis of cloudiness suggests three different scaling regimes of orographic
  land-atmosphere interactions:  1) a synoptic-scale regime (≥70-80km); 2) an orographic
  meso–β regime (30–70km) associated with the succession of wide valleys and bulky
  terrain features; and 3) an orographic meso–α regime (≤30km) associated with the
  complex succession of protruding south-facing ridges and narrow valleys that characterize
  the Himalayan foothills between altitudes of 3000 and 5000m elevations.'
