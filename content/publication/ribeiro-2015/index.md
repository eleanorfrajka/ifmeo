abstract: 'Mesoscale eddies are effective large-scale stirrers which provide a crucial connection
between mean flow scales, such as those in the Labrador Sea (LS) boundary currents, and small
scale dissipative processes. The relationship between currents and mesoscale eddies is not
straightforward, however, as currents have the potential to both produce and disintegrate
eddies. This study uses altimetric and AR7W hydrographic data to estimate mixing lengths and
relative lateral eddy diffusivities in the LS in order to determine whether there is suppression of
mixing by the LS boundary currents. In the West Greenland Current (WGC) across AR7W, a poor
relationship is identified between an altimeter-derived inverse suppression factor and both
mixing length (R = 0.4769, p = 0.0335) and relative lateral eddy diffusivity (R = 0.2293, p =
0.3309). This is interpreted as evidence for unsuppressed mixing. A close relationship is found
between surface Eddy Kinetic Energy and both mixing length (R= 0.9598, p < 0.0001) and
relative lateral eddy diffusivity (R =0.9918, p < 0.0001) in the WGC. Due to the weak tracer
gradient across isopycnals stemming laterally from the Labrador Current, results are robust
only in one cross section which crosses the WGC. Nonetheless, this study makes a first
quantification of mixing length and eddy diffusivity across a LS boundary current.'
