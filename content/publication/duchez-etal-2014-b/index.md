abstract: 'The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) has received considerable
  attention, motivated by its major role in the global climate system. Observations
  of AMOC strength at 26°N made by the Rapid Climate Change (RAPID) array provide
  the best current estimate of the state of the AMOC. The period 2004–11 when RAPID
  AMOC is available is too short to assess decadal variability of the AMOC. This modeling
  study introduces a new AMOC index (called AMOCSV) at 26°N that combines the Florida
  Straits transport, the Ekman transport, and the southward geostrophic Sverdrup transport.
  The main hypothesis in this study is that the upper midocean geostrophic transport
  calculated using the RAPID array is also wind-driven and can be approximated by
  the geostrophic Sverdrup transport at interannual and longer time scales. This index
  is expected to reflect variations in the AMOC at interannual to decadal time scales.
  This estimate of the surface branch of the AMOC can be constructed as long as reliable
  measurements are available for the Gulf Stream and for wind stress. To test the
  reliability of the AMOCSV on interannual and longer time scales, two different numerical
  simulations are used: a forced and a coupled simulation. Using these simulations
  the AMOCSV captures a substantial fraction of the AMOC variability and is in good
  agreement with the AMOC transport at 26°N on both interannual and decadal time scales.
  These results indicate that it might be possible to extend the observation-based
  AMOC at 26°N back to the 1980s.'
