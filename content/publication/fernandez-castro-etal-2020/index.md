abstract: 'A 4-month glider mission was analyzed to assess turbulent dissipation in
  an anticyclonic eddy at the western boundary of the subtropical North Atlantic.
  The eddy (radius ≈ 60 km) had a core of low potential vorticity between 100 and
  450 m, with maximum radial velocities of 0.5 m s−1 and Rossby number ≈ −0.1. Turbulent
  dissipation was inferred from vertical water velocities derived from the glider
  flight model. Dissipation was suppressed in the eddy core (ε ≈ 5 × 10−10 W kg−1)
  and enhanced below it (>10−9 W kg−1). Elevated dissipation was coincident with quasiperiodic
  structures in the vertical velocity and pressure perturbations, suggesting internal
  waves as the drivers of dissipation. A heuristic ray-tracing approximation was used
  to investigate the wave–eddy interactions leading to turbulent dissipation. Ray-tracing
  simulations were consistent with two types of wave–eddy interactions that may induce
  dissipation: the trapping of near-inertial wave energy by the eddy’s relative vorticity,
  or the entry of an internal tide (generated at the nearby continental slope) to
  a critical layer in the eddy shear. The latter scenario suggests that the intense
  mesoscale field characterizing the western boundaries of ocean basins might act
  as a “leaky wall” controlling the propagation of internal tides into the basin’s
  interior.'
