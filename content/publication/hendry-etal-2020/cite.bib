 abstract = {Today, we can celebrate a strong representation of women in sea-going science in the United Kingdom, providing positive role models for early-career female marine scientists. However, women continue to face challenges to their progression in their marine science careers, especially those who are also members of other under-represented groups. In this article we consider gender equity and equality in participation and leadership in sea-going marine science in the UK, discussing successes and lessons learned for the future. After a brief history of UK women in ocean science, and a summary of some recent advances in gender equality, we look at further areas in need of improvement, and ask whether successes in improved gender equality can be transferred to tackling other forms of under-representation in sea-going science.},
