abstract: Today, we can celebrate a strong representation of women in sea-going science
  in the United Kingdom, providing positive role models for early-career female marine
  scientists. However, women continue to face challenges to their progression in their
  marine science careers, especially those who are also members of other under-represented
  groups. In this article we consider gender equity and equality in participation
  and leadership in sea-going marine science in the UK, discussing successes and lessons
  learned for the future. After a brief history of UK women in ocean science, and
  a summary of some recent advances in gender equality, we look at further areas in
  need of improvement, and ask whether successes in improved gender equality can be
  transferred to tackling other forms of under-representation in sea-going science.
