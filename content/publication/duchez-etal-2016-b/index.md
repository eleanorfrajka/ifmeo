Overlaid is the Jet Stream displacement measure (ΔJS) represented with a solid grey line and smoothed using a 10-day running mean. Also shown is the difference in between the Southern Band (SB, 35–50°N) maximum SST and Northern Band (NB, 50–65°N) minimum SST (ΔSST, purple dash-dot line).'

abstract: 'The North Atlantic and Europe experienced two extreme climate events in
  2015: exceptionally cold ocean surface temperatures and a summer heat wave ranked
  in the top ten over the past 65 years. Here, we show that the cold ocean temperatures
  were the most extreme in the modern record over much of the mid-high latitude North-East
  Atlantic. Further, by considering surface heat loss, ocean heat content and wind
  driven upwelling we explain for the first time the genesis of this cold ocean anomaly.
  We find that it is primarily due to extreme ocean heat loss driven by atmospheric
  circulation changes in the preceding two winters combined with the re-emergence
  of cold ocean water masses. Furthermore, we reveal that a similar cold Atlantic
  anomaly was also present prior to the most devastating European heat waves since
  the 1980s indicating that it is a common factor in the development of these extreme
  events. For the specific case of 2015, we show that the ocean anomaly is linked
  to a stationary position of the Jet Stream that favours the development of high
  surface temperatures over Central Europe during the heat wave. Our study calls for
  an urgent assessment of the impact of ocean drivers on major European summer temperature
  extremes in order to provide better advance warning measures of these high societal
  impact events.'
