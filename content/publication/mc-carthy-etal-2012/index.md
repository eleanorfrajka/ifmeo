abstract: The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (MOC) plays a critical role
  in the climate system and is responsible for much of the heat transported by the
  ocean. A mooring array, nominally at 26°N between the Bahamas and the Canary Islands,
  deployed in Apr 2004 provides continuous measurements of the strength and variability
  of this circulation. With seven full years of measurements, we now examine the interannual
  variability of the MOC. While earlier results highlighted substantial seasonal and
  shorter timescale variability, there had not been significant interannual variability.
  The mean MOC from 1 Apr 2004 to the 31 March 2009 was 18.5 Sv with the annual means
  having a standard deviation of only 1.0 Sv. From 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2010,
  the annually averaged MOC strength was just 12.8 Sv, representing a 30% decline.
  This downturn persisted from early 2009 to mid-2010. We show that the cause of the
  decline was not only an anomalous wind-driven event from Dec 2009–Mar 2010 but also
  a strengthening of the geostrophic flow. In particular, the southward flow in the
  top 1100 m intensified, while the deep southward return transport—particularly in
  the deepest layer from 3000–5000 m—weakened. This rebalancing of the transport from
  the deep overturning to the upper gyre has implications for the heat transported
  by the Atlantic.
