abstract: 'The response of the North Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (MOC)
  to wind stress forcing is investigated from an observational standpoint, using four
  time series of overturning transports below and relative to 1000 m, overlapping
  by 3.6 yr. These time series are derived from four mooring arrays located on the
  western boundary of the North Atlantic: the RAPID Western Atlantic Variability Experiment
  (WAVE) array (42.5$^∘$N), the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Line W array
  (39$^∘$N), RAPID–MOC/MOCHA (26.5$^∘$N), and the Meridional Overturning Variability
  Experiment (MOVE) array (16$^∘$N). Using modal decompositions of the analytic cross-correlation
  between transports and wind stress, the basin-scale wind stress is shown to significantly
  drive the MOC coherently at four latitudes, on the time scales available for this
  study. The dominant mode of covariance is interpreted as rapid barotropic oceanic
  adjustments to wind stress forcing, eventually forming two counterrotating Ekman
  overturning cells centered on the tropics and subtropical gyre. A second mode of
  covariance appears related to patterns of wind stress and wind stress curl associated
  with the North Atlantic Oscillation, spinning anomalous horizontal circulations
  that likely interact with topography to form overturning cells.'
