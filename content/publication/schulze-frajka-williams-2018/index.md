abstract: 'The Labrador Sea is one of a small number of deep convection sites in the
  North Atlantic, that contribute to the meridional overturning circulation. Buoyancy
  is lost from surface waters during winter, allowing the formation of dense deep
  water. In the recent decades, mass loss from the Greenland ice sheet has accelerated,
  releasing freshwater into the high latitude North Atlantic. This and the enhanced
  Arctic freshwater export in the recent years have the potential to add buoyancy
  to the surface waters, slowing or suppressing convection in the Labrador Sea. However,
  the impact of freshwater on convection is dependent on whether or not it can escape
  the shallow, topographically-trapped boundary currents around Greenland and Labrador.
  Previous studies have estimated the transport of freshwater into the central Labrador
  Sea by focusing on the role of eddies. Here we use a Lagrangian approach, tracking
  particles in a global, eddy-permitting (1/12Â°) ocean model, to examine where and
  when freshwater enters the Labrador Sea basin in the surface 30m. We find that most
  freshwater enters in the east (near the west coast of Greenland), consistent with
  previous expectations. Seasonally two peaks of freshening are observed. The first
  peak occurs in the spring and results from a large number of shelf water particles.
  The second peak, occurring in the fall, is due to the low salinity of the West Greenland
  current at this time of the year. We find that in these simulations surface wind-driven
  Ekman transport, rather than eddies, are responsible for the larger year-to-year
  variability in freshwater transport from the shelves to the central Labrador Sea. '
