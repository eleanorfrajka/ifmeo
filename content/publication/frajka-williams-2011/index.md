abstract: 'The ocean conveyor is a term used to describe how a parcel of water initially at the
surface in high northern latitudes might travel at depth to the Southern Ocean, and then
return in surface currents (see Figure 1). The conveyor belt idea made its Hollywood
debut in the film ‘The Day after Tomorrow’ in which a palaeoclimatologist shows a similar
diagram to politicians. Soon after, large drops in temperature are recorded by weather
buoys off Greenland — a warning that the world is undergoing a massive climate shift
due to a shut down of the conveyor belt. In the film, the shutdown of the circulation
plunged the world into a new ice age, with glacial conditions spreading equatorward
more quickly than cars could drive. While the details of the film are only loosely based
on science, it raises a valid question: could the conveyor shut down and what would be
the consequences to the Earth climate system if it did?'
