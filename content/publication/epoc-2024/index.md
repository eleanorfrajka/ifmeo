publication: '*EPOC Project*'

abstract: 'The EPOC project aims to understand the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, including its variability, structure and connectivity between latitudes. We are firmly in the middle of the project, with exciting activities across the board: using high resolution numerical modelling, new observations and new analyses of existing observations, and combining these approaches to develop a new understanding of the circulation as a whole.

In this newsletter, we discuss how sediment cores reveal variability in the Gulf Stream during the last ice age, the fieldwork programme at 47Â°N in summer 2024, and provide a commentary on the AMOC and its potential shutdown.  We also introduce new early career researchers in the EPOC project.'

summary: 'Second newsletter of the EPOC project.'
