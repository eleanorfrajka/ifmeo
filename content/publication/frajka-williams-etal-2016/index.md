abstract: From ten years of observations of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation
  (MOC) at 26° N (2004–2014), we revisit the question of flow compensation between
  components of the circulation. Contrasting with early results from the observations,
  transport variations of the Florida Current (FC) and upper mid-ocean (UMO) transports
  (top 1000 m east of the Bahamas) are now found to compensate on sub-annual timescales.
  The observed compensation between the FC and UMO transports is associated with horizontal
  circulation and means that this part of the correlated variability does not project
  onto the MOC. A deep baroclinic response to wind-forcing (Ekman transport) is also
  found in the lower North Atlantic Deep Water (LNADW; 3000–5000 m) transport. In
  contrast, co-variability between Ekman and the LNADW transports does contribute
  to overturning. On longer timescales, the southward UMO transport has continued
  to strengthen, resulting in a continued decline of the MOC. Most of this interannual
  variability of the MOC can be traced to changes in isopycnal displacements on the
  western boundary, within the top 1000 m and below 2000 m. Substantial trends are
  observed in isopycnal displacements in the deep ocean, underscoring the importance
  of deep boundary measurements to capture the variability of the Atlantic MOC.
