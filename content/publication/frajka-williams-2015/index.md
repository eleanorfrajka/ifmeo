title: Estimating the Atlantic MOC at 26°N using satellite altimetry and cable measurements
subtitle: ''
summary: 'A statistical relationship between satellite sea surface height (SSH) and observed transports at 26°N is used to build a proxy for the AMOC transport since 1992.  The method relies on a strong relationship between (1) the interannual variability of spatially-smoothed SSH at the western boundary of the Atlantic and (2) the RAPID 26°N estimate of upper mid-ocean transport (UMO, top ~1100m) across the Atlantic.  Explained variance is very high, but the method assumes stationarity in the relationship between SSH and UMO, which would likely be violated on longer timescales associated with e.g., deep watermass change.'

abstract: Climate simulations predict a slowing of the Atlantic meridional overturning
  circulation (MOC), a key oceanic component of the climate system, while continuous
  observations of the MOC from boundary arrays demonstrate substantial variability
  on weekly to interannual time scales. These arrays are necessarily limited to individual
  latitudes. A potential proxy for the MOC covering longer time scales and larger
  spatial scales is desirable. Here we use sea surface height data from satellites
  to estimate the interannual variability of transbasin ocean transports at 26°N.
  Combining this estimate with surface Ekman transport and cable measurements of the
  Florida Current, we construct a time series of the MOC from 1993 to 2014. This satellite-based
  estimate recovers over 90% of the interannual variability of the MOC measured by
  the RAPID 26°N array. This analysis complements in situ observational efforts to
  measure the MOC at multiple latitudes and opens the door to a broader spatial understanding
  of the Atlantic circulation variability.
