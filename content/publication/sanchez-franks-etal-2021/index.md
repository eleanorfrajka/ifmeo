abstract: The large-scale system of ocean currents that transport warm waters in the
  upper 1000 m northward and return deeper cooler waters southward is known as the
  At- lantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). Varia- tions in the AMOC have
  significant repercussions for the climate system; hence, there is a need for long-term
  moni- toring of AMOC fluctuations. Currently the longest record of continuous directly
  measured AMOC changes is from the RAPID-MOCHA-WBTS programme, initiated in 2004.
  The RAPID programme and other mooring programmes have revolutionised our understanding
  of large-scale circulation; however, by design they are constrained to measurements
  at a single latitude and cannot tell us anything pre-2004.  Nearly global coverage
  of surface ocean data from satel- lite altimetry has been available since the launch
  of the TOPEX/Poseidon satellite in 1992 and has been shown to provide reliable estimates
  of surface ocean transports on in- terannual timescales including previous studies
  that have in- vestigated empirical correlations between sea surface height variability
  and the overturning circulation. Here we show a direct calculation of ocean circulation
  from satellite altime- try of the upper mid-ocean transport (UMO), the Gulf Stream
  transport through the Florida Straits (GS), and the AMOC using a dynamically based
  method that combines geostrophy with a time mean of the vertical structure of the
  flow from the 26◦ N RAPID moorings. The satellite-based transport cap- tures 56%,
  49%, and 69% of the UMO, GS, and AMOC transport variability, respectively, from
  the 26$^∘$N RAPID array on interannual (18-month) timescales. Further investi- gation
  into the vertical structure of the horizontal transport shows that the first baroclinic
  mode accounts for 83% of the interior geostrophic variability, and the combined
  barotropic and first baroclinic mode representation of dynamic height accounts for
  98% of the variability. Finally, the methods developed here are used to reconstruct
  the UMO and the AMOC for the time period pre-dating RAPID, 1993 to 2003. The effective
  implementation of satellite-based method for monitoring the AMOC at 26$^∘$N lays
  down the starting point for monitoring large-scale circulation at all latitudes.
