abstract: Sea surface temperatures in the northern North Atlantic have shown a marked
  decrease over the past several years.  The sea surface in the subpolar gyre is now
  as cold as it was during the last cold phase  of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation
  index in the 1990s.  This climate index is associated with shifts in hurricane activity,
  rainfall patterns and intensity, and changes in fish populations.  However, unlike
  the last cold period in the Atlantic, the spatial pattern of sea surface temperature
  anomalies in the Atlantic is not uniformly cool, but instead has anomalously  cold
  temperatures in the subpolar gyre, warm temperatures in the subtropics and cool
  anomalies over the tropics.   The tripole pattern of anomalies has increased the
  subpolar to subtropical meridional gradient in SSTs, which are not represented by
  the AMO index value, but which may lead to increased atmospheric baroclinicity and
  storminess.   Here we show that the recent Atlantic cooling is likely to persist,
  as predicted by a statistical forecast of subsurface ocean temperatures and consistent
  with the irreversible nature of watermass changes involved in the recent cooling
  of the subpolar gyre.
