  caption: 'Sea surface temperature anomalies and evolution. (a) SST (°C) from the ERSST dataset for the period July 2014–June 2016 are plotted relative to the average over July 2004–June 2012. The map was created using Generic Mapping Toolbox v5.2.1 (gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/). (b) Temporal evolution of the zonally-averaged SST as a function of latitude. Both panels show that the recent period has a cold anomaly in the subpolar gyre, but also a warm anomaly in the subtropics. (c) Line plots of the zonally-averaged SSTs, where each line represents an average of 2-years. The periods included are the early part of the last cold AMO period (1963–1973, blue) and the late part (1973–1996, red). Black shows the profile for the 2 year period: July 2014–June 2016. (d) NAO index where the bar for 2015 represents the December 2015–February 2016 period.'

abstract: Sea surface temperatures in the northern North Atlantic have shown a marked
  decrease over the past several years.  The sea surface in the subpolar gyre is now
  as cold as it was during the last cold phase  of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation
  index in the 1990s.  This climate index is associated with shifts in hurricane activity,
  rainfall patterns and intensity, and changes in fish populations.  However, unlike
  the last cold period in the Atlantic, the spatial pattern of sea surface temperature
  anomalies in the Atlantic is not uniformly cool, but instead has anomalously  cold
  temperatures in the subpolar gyre, warm temperatures in the subtropics and cool
  anomalies over the tropics.   The tripole pattern of anomalies has increased the
  subpolar to subtropical meridional gradient in SSTs, which are not represented by
  the AMO index value, but which may lead to increased atmospheric baroclinicity and
  storminess.   Here we show that the recent Atlantic cooling is likely to persist,
  as predicted by a statistical forecast of subsurface ocean temperatures and consistent
  with the irreversible nature of watermass changes involved in the recent cooling
  of the subpolar gyre.
