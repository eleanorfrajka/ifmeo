abstract: The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is a key component
  of the climate through its transport of heat in the North Atlantic Ocean. Decadal
  changes in the AMOC, whether through internal variability or anthropogenically forced
  weakening, therefore have wide-ranging impacts. In this Review, we synthesize the
  understanding of contemporary decadal variability in the AMOC, bringing together
  evidence from observations, ocean reanalyses, forced models and AMOC proxies. Since
  1980, there is evidence for periods of strengthening and weakening, although the
  magnitudes of change (5–25%) are uncertain. In the subpolar North Atlantic, the
  AMOC strengthened until the mid-1990s and then weakened until the early 2010s, with
  some evidence of a strengthening thereafter; these changes are probably linked to
  buoyancy forcing related to the North Atlantic Oscillation. In the subtropics, there
  is some evidence of the AMOC strengthening from 2001 to 2005 and strong evidence
  of a weakening from 2005 to 2014. Such large interannual and decadal variability
  complicates the detection of ongoing long-term trends, but does not preclude a weakening
  associated with anthropogenic warming. Research priorities include developing robust
  and sustainable solutions for the long-term monitoring of the AMOC, observation–modelling
  collaborations to improve the representation of processes in the North Atlantic
  and better ways to distinguish anthropogenic weakening from internal variability.
