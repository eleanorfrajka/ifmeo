abstract: The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is a key
  component of the climate through its transport of heat in the North Atlantic
  Ocean. Decadal changes in the AMOC, whether through internal variability or
  anthropogenically forced weakening, therefore have wide-ranging impacts. In
  this Review, we synthesize the understanding of contemporary decadal
  variability in the AMOC, bringing together evidence from observations, ocean
  reanalyses, forced models and AMOC proxies. Since 1980, there is evidence for
  periods of strengthening and weakening, although the magnitudes of change
  (5–25%) are uncertain. In the subpolar North Atlantic, the AMOC strengthened
  until the mid-1990s and then weakened until the early 2010s, with some
  evidence of a strengthening thereafter; these changes are probably linked to
  buoyancy forcing related to the North Atlantic Oscillation. In the subtropics,
  there is some evidence of the AMOC strengthening from 2001 to 2005 and strong
  evidence of a weakening from 2005 to 2014. Such large interannual and decadal
  variability complicates the detection of ongoing long-term trends, but does
  not preclude a weakening associated with anthropogenic warming. Research
  priorities include developing robust and sustainable solutions for the
  long-term monitoring of the AMOC, observation–modelling collaborations to
  improve the representation of processes in the North Atlantic and better ways
  to distinguish anthropogenic weakening from internal variability.
