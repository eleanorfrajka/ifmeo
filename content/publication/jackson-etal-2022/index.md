abstract: The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is a key
  component of the climate through its transport of heat in the North Atlantic
  Ocean. Decadal changes in the AMOC, whether through internal variability or
  anthropogenically forced weakening, therefore have wide-ranging impacts. In
  this Review, we synthesize the understanding of contemporary decadal
  variability in the AMOC, bringing together evidence from observations, ocean
  reanalyses, forced models and AMOC proxies. Since 1980, there is evidence for
  periods of strengthening and weakening, although the magnitudes of change
  (5–25%) are uncertain. In the subpolar North Atlantic, the AMOC strengthened
  until the mid-1990s and then weakened until the early 2010s, with some
  evidence of a strengthening thereafter; these changes are probably linked to
  buoyancy forcing related to the North Atlantic Oscillation. In the subtropics,
  there is some evidence of the AMOC strengthening from 2001 to 2005 and strong
  evidence of a weakening from 2005 to 2014. Such large interannual and decadal
  variability complicates the detection of ongoing long-term trends, but does
  not preclude a weakening associated with anthropogenic warming. Research
  priorities include developing robust and sustainable solutions for the
  long-term monitoring of the AMOC, observation–modelling collaborations to
  improve the representation of processes in the North Atlantic and better ways
  to distinguish anthropogenic weakening from internal variability.

  caption: "Reconstructed Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) in
    the subpolar North Atlantic (left): AMOC from observations along the
    Portugal-Greenland A25-OVIDE  (panel a); AMOC from observations at 45°N
    (panel b); implied overturning in density space from observed surface fluxes
    (panel c); AMOC at 50° N from an ensemble mean of ocean reanalyses (black)
    and GloSea5 reanalysis (green) (panel d); and AMOC at 50°N from forced
    models participating in OMIP  (panel e). Reconstructed AMOC in the
    subtropical North Atlantic (right): AMOC at 26.5°N from the RAPID array
    (panel f); AMOC from observations at 26.5°N (panel g); AMOC from
    observations at 41° N (panel h); as in panel d but for the AMOC at 26.5°N
    (panel i); and as in panel e but for the AMOC at 26.5°N (panel j). AMOC is
    either the maximum of the overturning in density space (AMOCd; blue, right
    axis) or the maximum in depth space (AMOCz; black, left axis). Dashed lines
    indicate those timeseries wherein the wind-driven Ekman component is
    excluded. Shading indicates observational uncertainties for panels b, c and
    h, or twice the ensemble standard deviation for panels d, e, i and j. "
