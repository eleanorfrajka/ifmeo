abstract: The Gulf Stream in the Atlantic carries warm water northwards and forms
  both the return closure of the subtropical gyre as well as the upper limb of the
  meridional overturning circulation. Recent time series recorded east of the Bahamas
  at 26°N indicate that from May 2009 to April 2011, in contrast with past observations,
  the northward flowing Antilles Current covaried with the Gulf Stream in the Florida
  Straits—the Florida Current—even though the Florida and Antilles Currents are separated
  by banks and islands spanning 150 km. The peak-to-trough amplitude of transport
  variations during this period was 15 × 106 m3 s−1 for the Florida Current and 12 × 106 m3 s−1
  for the Antilles Current, at time scales of 50 days to a year. From satellite observations,
  we show that the fluctuations in both the Florida and Antilles Currents between
  May 2009 and April 2011 are driven by eddy activity east of the Bahamas. Since the
  Florida Current time series is a critical time series for the state of the oceans,
  and often compared to climate models, this newly identified source of variability
  needs careful consideration when attributing the variability of the Florida Current
  to changes in the larger-scale circulations (e.g., gyre and overturning) or wind
  forcing.
