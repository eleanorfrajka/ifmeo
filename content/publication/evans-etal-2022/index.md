abstract: The fate of mesoscale eddy kinetic energy represents a large source of uncertainty
  in the global ocean energy budget. Satellite altimetry suggests that mesoscale eddies
  vanish at ocean western boundaries. However, the fate of the eddies’ kinetic energy
  remains poorly known. Here we show that the generation of small-scale turbulence
  as eddy flow impinges on the steep and corrugated slope of an ocean western boundary
  plays a dominant role in the regional decay of mesoscale eddy kinetic energy. We
  compare altimetry-based estimates of mesoscale eddy kinetic energy decline with
  measurements of turbulent dissipation. Mesoscale eddies are found to decay at a
  rate of 0.016 ± 0.012 GW and 0.023 ± 0.017 GW for anticyclonic and cyclonic eddies,
  respectively, similar to the observed turbulent dissipation rate of 0.020 ± 0.011
  GW. This demonstrates that a major direct transfer of mesoscale eddy kinetic energy
  to small, dissipative scales can be effectively triggered by the eddies’ interaction
  with the western boundary topography.
