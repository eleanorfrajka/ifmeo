The **Experimental Oceanography** group aims to advance our understanding of ocean dynamics and circulation in a changing climate.  We are a seagoing group, specialising in physical oceanographic measurements and using approaches that leverage traditional observations with new platforms and satellite data.  Using a range of observational platforms enables us to address problems spanning scales (from micro- to large-scale), and spanning spheres (from the ocean to biogeosphere, cryosphere and atmosphere).  We are driven by scientific curiosity, and motivated by problems with the potential to address societal needs.
