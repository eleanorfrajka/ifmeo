### Objective and basic information on data processing
This privacy policy explains the nature, scope and purpose of the processing of personal data within our online offering and the websites, functions and content associated with it. The privacy policy applies regardless of the domains, systems, platforms and devices (e.g. desktop or mobile) on which the online offer is executed.

We process personal data of our users only in compliance with the relevant data protection provisions in accordance with the principles of data economy and data avoidance. It follows that the processing of personal data of our users regularly takes place only after the consent of the user. An exception applies in those cases in which the processing of the data is permitted by legal regulations.

We take organizational, contractual and technical security measures in accordance with the state of the art to ensure that the provisions of data protection laws are complied with and thus to protect the data processed by us against accidental or intentional manipulation, loss, destruction or against access by unauthorized persons.

If content, tools or other means of third-party providers (e.g. YouTube videos) are used within the scope of our online offer and their named registered office is abroad, it is to be assumed that a data transfer to the registered office states of the third-party providers takes place.

- "User" means all customers and visitors to our Website, which term shall be understood to be gender-neutral;

- "Website or Online Offer" means, on an overarching basis, the content and functions contained on our Website and connected to the Website;

- "Third-party providers" other providers that are different from us, whose content, tools or other means we use as part of our online offering and whose named registered office may be abroad. For example, video platforms such as YouTube are to be mentioned here.
