# EO Meetings & Scheduling

Eleanor's public facing calendar is [here](https://shorturl.at/pqwPT).

If you're a student or colleague, or have already received an e-mail from Eleanor about meeting, please e-mail directly to suggest a timeslot which is empty or marked "Free" on my calendar.  Otherwise, please contact [Francisca Terrassa](mailto:francisca.terrassa@uni-hamburg.de).

## Group meetings

We meet weekly (typically on Thursdays) as a full group in 253.  Prospective group members are recommended to join a meeting.  During term time, postdocs and graduate students are expected to attend.

- The first meeting of the month is a 'general update' meeting, where each group member can give an update.  These can be something cool you learned or did this week, a problem you want group input on, or a technical point.
- Other meetings are topic-based including science talks by group members, fieldwork updates, workshopping figures, discussing curriculum and teaching, methods, writing proposals or general skills items (e.g. practicing elevator pitches for students).

## Individual/sub-group meetings with Eleanor

All group members are invited to schedule meetings using the calendly link [http://calendly.com/eleanorfrajka](http://calendly.com/eleanorfrajka).   This automatically adds the meeting to my calendar and sends you a confirmation e-mail that you can use to cancel or change the meeting.

- When you sign up for a meeting, please try to put it at the beginning or end of the available time range, so that meetings are back-to-back.  This allows me to get on with focused tasks outside of regular meetings.
- When you sign up for a meeting, please use your name (possibly followed by the purpose of the meeting).  
- For zoom meetings, please add me (eleanor.frajka@uni-hamburg.de) as a contact in zoom.  [See instructions here (external)](https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/article?id=zm_kb&sysparm_article=KB0065609).  This way, you can directly video call me.
- If you no longer need the meeting, please cancel it using the cancellation link in the confirmation e-mail.

Suggested meeting frequency:
- Postdocs and PhD students up to weekly for 1 hour,
- MSc and BSc students, up to every-other-week for 30 minutes.

In special circumstances, additional meetings can be scheduled, for instance if you are stuck and have exhausted other available resources (including other group members) to get unstuck.  If none of the times in Calendly work for you, then let Eleanor/[Francisca](mailto:francisca.terrassa@uni-hamburg.de) know.

## Meeting preparation

Please arrive prepared for all meetings.  

- You should typically prepare a few slides in advance of the meeting, starting with an agenda/goal of meeting slide, the relevant scientific content, and a what's next/to-do slide to close.  The agenda slide should list all distinct points that you would like to cover during the meeting, so that we don't spend too much time on one point and fail to get to all points.  

- Plan to take notes during the meeting, in whatever format you prefer. One way to do this would be to add notes onto the slides themselves, or at the end of the slide deck, so that the slides become a running record of meetings, feedback and plans for next steps.

- For students, please keep a running list of upcoming deadlines on the agenda slide (e.g., reports or talks due as part of the thesis process).

- After the meeting, please share a PDF version of your slides to a shared OwnCloud folder.  The slides should have the meeting date in the name, e.g. ''20240108_Lastname.pdf''.

## Calendar invites

For non-Calendly meetings, please use a digital calendar to schedule meetings (e.g., outlook or google calendar). The calendar invite should include a short and useful name.  For instance, if you have a panel meeting coming up, please don't simply call it 'Panel meeting', but something like 'Kate Panel Meeting'.  The meeting invite should include a zoom link (if applicable) in the location field, and an agenda or bullet points for discussion in the 'notes' section of the invite.

- All UHH members should have access to outlook calendars.  You can find yours via this [Outlook on the Web](https://exchange.uni-hamburg.de/owa) link.  

- To send an outlook invite using *Outlook on the Web*, see [Schedule with outlook on the web (external)](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/schedule-with-outlook-on-the-web-68e9b7e8-33c0-4258-9eee-1b8d626dab5a).  Add my e-mail address in the 'invite people' section (eleanor.frajka@uni-hamburg.de).  

- To send an outlook invite using the *desktop application for Outlook*, follow these instructions [Create a meeting in Outlook (external)](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/office/create-a-meeting-or-appointment-in-outlook-for-mac-689abe2a-4be7-4299-be4a-736adc36fc79).

- If you use a *google calendar*, you can send the invite following these instructions [Invite people to your calendar event (external)](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37161?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop).  Again, use my e-mail address (eleanor.frajka@uni-hamburg.de) in the 'guests' field.

If you need to cancel a meeting, you should be able to delete it from your calendar and select "send update" or "update invitees" when you do so, so that it is also deleted from my calendar.  If you don't see this option, then please e-mail me when you cancel a meeting so that I know not to expect you.

## Online meetings

For online meetings, I prefer Zoom.  I am able to use Teams meetings, but only through a web browser, which has limited functionality.

For zoom meetings, please add me as a contact in zoom.  See ['Adding and managing Zoom contacts' (external)](https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/article?id=zm_kb&sysparm_article=KB0065609).  This is straightforward with the desktop client for zoom.  Once added (and once I have confirmed), I should show up in your "External" list of contacts.  With contacts, it is possible to start a video call by clicking the small video camera icon next to the name (i.e., it is not necessary to create zoom links for each meeting).
