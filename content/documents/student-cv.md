## Purpose of the CV


## General stylistic choices

**Ordered by date:**
My preference (and common usage in oceanography) is to organise by date (MM/YYYY or YYYY/MM) or date range (MM/YYYY-MM/YYYY, or MM/YYYY - present).  The exact date format is up to you, but should be consistent throughout the CV.  Additionally, within each section, you can add activities in *chronological* (first to latest) order or *reverse chronological* order (most recent first).  My preference is reverse chronological, since one might expect that the most recent activites are most relevant.  However, the choice is up to you - but whatever you choose, _be consistent_ throughout the CV.

**Single language:** 
Preferably use a single language throughout your CV with the exception of proper nouns.  So, if you're writing your CV in English, translate everything (with the exception of street names, possibly universities e.g., Universit√§t Hamburg, and things like "Abitur").  Other elements should be translated, like your degree subject area "Geophysics/Oceanography" or "Institute of Oceanography". 

**Consistency:** Throughout your CV, use consistent grammatical choices, punctuation, date formatting, etc.  

## Standard sections

### Personal details

- **Title:** Absent
- **What to include:** Your name, address (home or work), e-mail address (ideally associated with your university *or* an address that you will have even after your studies are done), date of birth (optional, may be expected for e.g., France or Germany), nationality (optional, may be expected for e.g., France or Germany).

You may also include a "personal profile" or "motivation statement" or similar which can be a paragraph (no more than 4 sentences or so) giving a brief description of who you are, your basic qualifications and (work-relevant) interests.

### Education

- **Title:** "Education"  

Your educational experience in *reverse chronological order* (i.e., most recent activity first).

### Professional Experience 

- **Title:** Can be "Work Experience" or "Professional Experience", or "Internships and Professional Experience" or "Internships and Qualifications"
- **What to include:** Any jobs, internships or similar for which you were paid.  You can choose to mostly only include ones relevant to your current job aspirations, or also other longer activities that speak to your reliability/transferrable skills.

Note that once you have finished your formal education, this section will likely directly follow the "Personal Details" section of your CV.

### Fieldwork Experience (optional)

- **Title:** Can be "Field experience" or "Research Expeditions" or "Fieldwork"
- **What to include:** Research cruise activities or land-based fieldwork.  For students, you can also include fieldwork courses which included seagoing/ship-time.

Normally here you would detail the duration of time at sea (in days or weeks, as appropriate), the name of the ship, the aim of the activity and/or your responsibility on the ship.

### Skills and competencies

- **Title:** Can be "Skills and Competencies" or "Skills and Certificates" 
- **What to include:** Skills including languages, boating level certificates, computer skills (e.g., Python or other languages, LaTeX, Unix, shell-scripting), drivers license, diving certifications, and various other

If you speak more than one language, this is useful to include.  An indication of the level (e.g., A2, B1, B2, C1) is also helpful.

### Personal interests

- **Title:** Can be  "Interests and Hobbies" or "Interests and Volunteer Work"
- **What to include:** This is very open and also optional.  You can include things like sports, playing an instrument, volunteer activities, 



## Adaptations for other countries

Various countries have different expectations for what is included in a CV.  You may adapt your CV to these expectations or not, as you see fit.

- **Germany:** Often additional details such as marital status, date of birth and a photograph (mugshot) are included
- **France:** Typically your personal details section includes your residential address, date of birth and nationality.
