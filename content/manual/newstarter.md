**Welcome to IfM Experimental Oceanography!**

{{< toc >}}



## Where are we?

Physically, we are located in Bundesstr. 53 [Directions](https://www.ifm.uni-hamburg.de/en/institute/contact-map.html) on the 2nd floor (as well as some offices/labs on the 3rd and 4th floor of the Geomatikum). The building (Bundesstr. 53) is normally locked on the weekend.  Access can be granted by security guards on the ground floor of the Geomatikum (tall brown building).

On the university-side of Bundesstr. 53, we have:
- 1st floor: Data Assimilation and Remote Sensing group (Detlef Stammer)
- 2nd floor: Experimental Oceanography and Sea Ice groups (Eleanor Frajka-Williams, Dirk Notz)
- 3rd floor: Climate modelling group (Johanna Baehr)
- 4th floor: Theoretical Oceanography group (Carsten Eden)
- Geomatikum: Additional offices/labs for Experimental Oceanography on 3rd floor (Martin Gade) and 4th floor (Andreas Welsch)

On the second floor, we have
- A seminar/meeting room (253): Equipped with teleconference system, projector, and conference table.  Xisca has a key.  Availability and booking can be checked by contacting Xisca (or Maite - 1st floor, Martina - 4th floor).  Larger seminars/meetings can be held in 022/23 on the ground floor (capacity 60-70 persons) but are often booked during term-time for teaching.
- Shared kitchen, equipped with coffee machine, kettle, fridge, dishwasher. 
    - The coffee machine free for all to use.  Thomas Wasilewski can advise on operation/cleaning.  Generally, turn on and press button on the right next to a single cup. If usual coffee drinkers occasionally bring a bag of beans to re-supply, then we can keep it as free to use.  
    - Dishwasher. Please empty the dishwasher when you see it needs it.  Cleaning staff do not do this for us.
- Printer room (251): Printers z0251-c1, z0251-c3, z0251-m2, fax machine and University printer/copier (for use with CopyCard).


We also share the building with the [Max-Planck Institut für Meteorologie](https://mpimet.mpg.de/) which currently has an ocean group (Jochem Marotzke) and an atmospheres group (Bjorn Stevens).


Organisationally, the Experimental Oceanography group is one working group in the [Institut für Meereskunde](https://www.ifm.uni-hamburg.de/en.html) which is part of the [Center for Earth System Research and Sustainability (CEN)](https://www.cen.uni-hamburg.de).  We are part of the [MIN faculty - Mathematics, Informatics and Natural Sciences](https://www.min.uni-hamburg.de/en/ueber-die-fakultaet.html) at the [Universität Hamburg](https://www.uni-hamburg.de).

We are affiliated with the Cluster of Excellence [CLICCS - Climate, Climatic Change, and Society](https://www.cliccs.uni-hamburg.de) which also includes folks from [Meteorological Institute](https://www.mi.uni-hamburg.de/en/institut.html), the [Institute of Soil Science](https://www.geo.uni-hamburg.de/en/bodenkunde/ueber-das-institut.html), the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/en.html), the [Geology-Paleontology Institut](https://www.geo.uni-hamburg.de/en/geologie/ueber-das-institut.html), the [Department of Social Sciences](https://www.wiso.uni-hamburg.de/en/fachbereich-sowi.html) and others.

## Coming from abroad

### German Language

#### Translation apps and browsers

Get to know the translating options on your computer and in your web browser.  
- In Chrome and Safari, this shows up to the right of the URL address where you can select the language to translate to.  If you don't see the option, try re-loading/refreshing the page.
- Online translation tools: 
	- [Google translate](https://translate.google.com) - can be used to translate text and also documents (PDF works well).
	- [Deepl](https://www.deepl.com/translator) - sometimes more accurate than Google translate, but the option to translate documents may not be free.
- Software for translation - you can also download an app for Deepl to your computer.  This saves you from trying to find which browser window the translation is in.
- On a Mac, you can select any text then right click and select 'translate'.

#### Language learning at UHH

At the University, you can take courses through the [Deutsch als Fremdsprache (German as a foreign language)](https://www.uni-hamburg.de/sprachenzentrum/daf.html).  These are offered in term time, normally in Von-Melle-Park (about a 10-minute walk from Bu53) or as intensive courses (2 weeks) before term starts.  An online test or previous certificate is required to set your level.

They will ask you to register in Stine (our online course management software) but if you are not registered as a student, this doesn't seem to be possible.  You can alternatively contact the organiser or the lecturer for the course you are interested, in order to be added.

#### Language learning apps

Duolingo offers a quick way to get started (but not very fast to progress).

Busuu is a paid option which matches the typical courses (A1.1, A1.2, B2.1, B2.2).

#### Other language learning options?

There are a lot of other places in Hamburg to take language classes. 
- Goethe Institut (more expensive, online or near Hauptbahnhof, intensive/evening/weekend courses)
- City run courses (inexpensive)
- UNS in Hoheluft (intensive courses)
- others?

### Hamburg Welcome Center

There is a lot of helpful information found at the [Hamburg Welcome Center](https://www.hamburg.com/welcome/hwc/) including webinars about taxes and schools.  A lot (but not all) information is available in English.

### School Information Center (Schulinformationszentrum)

The [school information center](https://welcome.hamburg.de/schule/4591016/siz/) is where you need to sign up to get your kids registered in school.  Normally, they will require your child's Meldebestatigung (registration certificate) which you receive at the end of your registration appointment (Anmeldung).

Note that school holidays in Germany are at all different times (intentionally, to reduce impact on transport).  Calendars can be found by googling "School holidays in Hamburg", e.g. [here](https://www.holidays-info.com/germany/school-holidays/hamburg/).

### University service for 'newly appointed'

The university has a service for newly appointed professors and their [website](https://www.kus.uni-hamburg.de/en/themen/berufungen/neuberufene/service.html) has a lot of useful information.

### Bike rentals (short and medium term)

- There is a local bike rental service in Hamburg called [Stadtrad](https://stadtrad.hamburg.de/en/home/).  You can download their app, sign up (small fee) and then use the app to check out bikes and check them back in at designated spots in the city. 
- For medium term (monthly) rental, [Swapfiets](https://swapfiets.de/hamburg) is an option.  For something like €23/mo you can rent a bike.  On first rental, you can either pick it up in Altona at their shop or ask for an appointment where they will bring it to you.
