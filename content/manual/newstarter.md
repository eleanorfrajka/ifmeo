**Welcome to IfM Experimental Oceanography!**

{{< toc >}}



## Where are we?

Physically, we are located in Bundesstr. 53 [Directions](https://www.ifm.uni-hamburg.de/en/institute/contact-map.html) on the 2nd floor (as well as some offices/labs on the 3rd and 4th floor of the Geomatikum). The building (Bundesstr. 53) is normally locked on the weekend.  Access can be granted by security guards on the ground floor of the Geomatikum (tall brown building).

On the university-side of Bundesstr. 53, we have:
- 1st floor: Data Assimilation and Remote Sensing group (Detlef Stammer)
- 2nd floor: Experimental Oceanography and Sea Ice groups (Eleanor Frajka-Williams, Dirk Notz)
- 3rd floor: Climate modelling group (Johanna Baehr)
- 4th floor: Theoretical Oceanography group (Carsten Eden)
- Geomatikum: Additional offices/labs for Experimental Oceanography on 3rd floor (Martin Gade) and 4th floor (Andreas Welsch)

On the second floor, we have
- A seminar/meeting room (253): Equipped with teleconference system, projector, and conference table.  Xisca has a key.  Availability and booking can be checked by contacting Xisca (or Maite - 1st floor, Martina - 4th floor).  Larger seminars/meetings can be held in 022/23 on the ground floor (capacity 60-70 persons) but are often booked during term-time for teaching.
- Shared kitchen, equipped with coffee machine, kettle, fridge, dishwasher. 
    - The coffee machine free for all to use.  Thomas Wasilewski can advise on operation/cleaning.  Generally, turn on and press button on the right next to a single cup. If usual coffee drinkers occasionally bring a bag of beans to re-supply, then we can keep it as free to use.  
    - Dishwasher. Please empty the dishwasher when you see it needs it.  Cleaning staff do not do this for us.
- Printer room (251): Printers z0251-c1, z0251-c3, z0251-m2, fax machine and University printer/copier (for use with CopyCard).


We also share the building with the [Max-Planck Institut für Meteorologie](https://mpimet.mpg.de/) which currently has an ocean group (Jochem Marotzke) and an atmospheres group (Bjorn Stevens).


Organisationally, the Experimental Oceanography group is one working group in the [Institut für Meereskunde](https://www.ifm.uni-hamburg.de/en.html) which is part of the [Center for Earth System Research and Sustainability (CEN)](https://www.cen.uni-hamburg.de).  We are part of the [MIN faculty - Mathematics, Informatics and Natural Sciences](https://www.min.uni-hamburg.de/en/ueber-die-fakultaet.html) at the [Universität Hamburg](https://www.uni-hamburg.de).

We are affiliated with the Cluster of Excellence [CLICCS - Climate, Climatic Change, and Society](https://www.cliccs.uni-hamburg.de) which also includes folks from [Meteorological Institute](https://www.mi.uni-hamburg.de/en/institut.html), the [Institute of Soil Science](https://www.geo.uni-hamburg.de/en/bodenkunde/ueber-das-institut.html), the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/en.html), the [Geology-Paleontology Institut](https://www.geo.uni-hamburg.de/en/geologie/ueber-das-institut.html), the [Department of Social Sciences](https://www.wiso.uni-hamburg.de/en/fachbereich-sowi.html) and others.

## Planning

Latest [UHH info on Corona/Covid19](https://www.uni-hamburg.de/en/newsroom/intern/2020/0323-auswirkungen-mitarbeitende.html).  At the moment, restrictions are light (with the exception of the requirement to wear medical masks on public transport).

### Meetings within the group 

- Weekly group meetings (Thursdays 1pm in 253)
- ~Fortnightly 1-1 meetings with Eleanor (use [calendly](http://calendly.com/eleanorfrajka) to schedule, or let Eleanor/Xisca know if none of the times work for you.)

Weekly meetings will be likely change in time by semester, due to teaching/classes and other conflicts.

The university calendar can be found [here](https://www.uni-hamburg.de/en/campuscenter/studienorganisation/studienverlauf/semestertermine.html).

### Seminars 

Lots of seminars are on in the Institut, as well as dissertation talks by MSc and PhD students.

- Wednesdays at 13:30 are the Joint Seminar (often in-house)
- Thursdays at 15:15 are the KlimaCampus Kolloquium (often external speakers).
These are held in 022/023.

The TRR181 seminar series is every other week in the semester with [details here](https://www.trr-energytransfers.de/events). Email announcements come via the members.cen email list.

The CEN lecture series on `Sustainability and Climate Risks' is on Wednesdays from 16:15-17:45 (hybrid), with [details here](https://www.fnk.uni-hamburg.de/3-teaching/lectureseriesfnk.html).

In the winter term, there is the GSEM seminar by students.  Time TBD, but in 2022/23 this was Wednesdays at 15:30, announced by Thomas Pohlmann.

## Computing

IT support:
- CEN-IT is IT support for the Centre for Earth System Research & Sustainability (CEN): [https://www.cen.uni-hamburg.de/en/facilities/cen-it.html](https://www.cen.uni-hamburg.de/en/facilities/cen-it.html)
- RRZ is the IT for the whole university: [https://www.rrz.uni-hamburg.de](https://www.rrz.uni-hamburg.de)

Within the IfM/Experimental Oceanography group, Thomas Wasilewski is a point of contact for CEN-IT.


### User IDs <a name='bkennung'></a>

You will have a Benutzerkennung (University-wide) and a u-nummer (CEN-specific).  

- The **B-kennung** (e.g. *bbbXXX*) is for university-wide access and single sign on (e.g. Zoom, email, eduroam, mailing lists, etc).  Your e-mail address is bbbXXXX at uni-hamburg.de, but a more user-friendly mail alias will be automatically created for you using your *firstname.lastname@uni-hamburg.de*.

- The **u-nummer** is CEN-specific, and is used to access the HPC cluster, Mattermost, ownCloud, Confluence.


### Internet access
 
- **Eduroam<a name='eduroam'></a>**. Instructions for configuring eduroam access (using your B-kennung) can be found here: [https://www.rrz.uni-hamburg.de/services/netz/wlan.html](https://www.rrz.uni-hamburg.de/services/netz/wlan.html) - a pop-up also appears when you connect to WiFi 'UHH'

- **LAN (ethernet) access**. Your MAC address from computer or adapter needs to be registered in order to use ethernet in offices: request from helpdesk.cen@uni-hamburg.de).  Normally only added for University computers.

- **VPN (for access from off-campus)**. To access Hamburg's VPN use Cisco AnyConnect.  This is best set up while at UHH. [https://www.rrz.uni-hamburg.de/services/netz/vpn.html](https://www.rrz.uni-hamburg.de/services/netz/vpn.html)
