This document outlines the agreement made between the Student and Advisor for the undertaking of a dissertation research project at UHH. The purpose of the document is to clarify expectations. If anything herein conflicts with the University, Faculty or Academic programme requirements or guidelines, or those of the relevant courses, then those guidelines supersede what is written here. The agreement is open for discussion or revision by mutual agreement at any time during the project work.

**Expectations of the Student:** The most important expectation to communicate is that you, the Student, should take ownership over your educational and research experience. From the choice of your Advisor, research project and through to degree completion, you carry the primary responsibility for your success.

**Expectations of the Advisor:** The Advisor’s primary task is to facilitate your research and educational experience, to guide the Student in their research project and foster independent learning. The Advisor should promote conditions conducive to the Student’s research and intellectual growth, providing guidance on the progress of the research and the standards expected.


## It is the Student's responsibility to


1. Grow intellectually, developing the skills and learning approaches necessary for the project;

2. Learn about all appropriate deadline dates and regulations associated with the degree
requirements, and inform the Advisor of deadlines well in advance;

3. Complete research work and produce a dissertation that is their own work, reflecting a capacity
for independent scholarship in the discipline;

4. Conform to requirements and academic standards of the Faculty, Academic unit and degree
program, including those pertaining to dissertation style, intellectual property, academic
misconduct, and any relevant safety and/or workplace regulations;

5. Meet regularly with the Advisor (or designate), and arrive prepared for all scheduled meetings;

6. Recognise that the Advisor has other educational, research and service obligations;

7. Request changes to regular meetings with 24 hours notice, when possible;

8. Manage their own time, recognising that research often takes longer than expected;

9. Take advantage of analysis, coding and research input from fellow students, PhD students and/or
researchers, where applicable;

10. At the end of the project, make available to the Advisor all original research materials (data files,
dissertation file Word or tex format, original figures and analysis scripts), where appropriate;

11. Consider and respond to advice and criticisms provided by the Advisor, in a timely manner.

12. Be prepared to approach the Advisor and/or the course coordinator when any perceived problems
or changes in circumstances could affect performance;

##  It is the Advisor’s responsibility to

1. Facilitate the Student’s intellectual growth and contribution to a field of knowledge;

2. Ensure that the Student’s dissertation project is suitably aligned with the educational programme
objectives and manageable in the time allocated;

3. Assist the Student in developing their research interests, and help them modify the program when
unforeseen problems arise;

4. Establish a professional working relationship to guide the student in their independent project;

5. Be open, honest and fair with the Student when providing feedback on academic performance;

6. Be reasonably accessible to the Student via electronic communication or in person for consultation and discussion of the student’s academic progress and research problems;


7. Provide 24 hours notice—when possible—when cancelling an appointment;

8. Examine and make constructive suggestions for improvement on formal written work;

9. Give ample notice of extended absences from campus, and make arrangements for the advising
of the student when on extended absence from the campus;

10. Make reasonable arrangements, within the norms appropriate to the discipline and limits of
resources of the University, so that the research resources necessary for execution of the
student’s dissertation are available;

11. Give credit in an appropriate manner to Student contributions to scholarly activity, e.g.,

    - Where the Student’s intellectual contribution to the work is small, e.g. in the case of routine work without an active role in experimental design, execution, or data analysis, the Student will be acknowledged but not as a co-author.

    - Where the Student has made a substantive intellectual contribution to the work, but has not taken the lead role in design, execution and anaysis, the Student will be a co-author.

    - Where the Student has had a major intellectual contribution to the work, and has led the design, execution and data analysis, the Student will be the lead author.

    - No manuscript, abstract or poster will be submitted for consideration by a scholarly journal or meeting unless its content has been approved by all co-authors.

## Specifics (as of 2023)

1. Regular meetings: I propose the following frequency and format of meetings:
    - Bi-weekly (every other week) for 30 min, to be scheduled on a term basis. Frequency or duration may be changed by mutual agreement. During periods where the student plans to be otherwise occupied (i.e., limited progress anticipated), meetings should be deleted.
    - Weekly group meetings of 1–1.5 hours, to be scheduled on a term basis. These will provide opportunities to discuss work in a wider group.

2. Regular report of progress: In advance of regular meetings, please digitally share with me a progress report. This should be short (0.5–2 pages), include the date and given an outline of past plans, progress made and next steps in bullet format. The compilation of these reports are useful as a record of your progress through time. Name your file something sensible that promotes organisation, e.g.: *YYYYMMDD-Lastname-dissupdate.pdf*.  Suggested headings are:
    - Action items from last meeting
    - Aim of work since last meeting
    - Progress since last meeting
    - Next steps - which may include carried over action items from previous meetings
  

3. Feedback on written work: Normally, I will review each piece of formal written work in full draft
format only once, i.e. not an introduction section one week, and a methods section another week. Normally, comments should be returned to the student within two weeks. I strongly recommend that we discuss an outline of planned writing prior to full format writing; outlines can be discussed multiple times.

4. Scheduling: There are three options for scheduling meetings:
    - In person during a meeting, we can pick future meetings or set up regular meetings;
    - Using the http://calendly.com/eleanorfrajka link for group members;
    - E-mailing Francisca Terrassa for a meeting (especially any meetings requiring participation of multiple people and therefore may involve iterations).
    - Less reliable ways of scheduling meetings with me include e-mailing, messaging in Mattermost or catching me in the hallway. Note that I organise my meetings using the University outlook calendar, and meetings that do not appear in my calendar are liable to be forgotten.
