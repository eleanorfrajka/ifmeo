**Coming from abroad (or another city, or non-native German speaker)**

{{< toc >}}


## German Language

### Translation apps and browsers

Get to know the translating options on your computer and in your web browser.  
- In Chrome and Safari, this shows up to the right of the URL address where you can select the language to translate to.  If you don't see the option, try re-loading/refreshing the page.
- Online translation tools: 
	- [Google translate](https://translate.google.com) - can be used to translate text and also documents (PDF works well).
	- [Deepl](https://www.deepl.com/translator) - sometimes more accurate than Google translate, but the option to translate documents may not be free.
- Software for translation - you can also download an app for Deepl to your computer.  This saves you from trying to find which browser window the translation is in.
- On a Mac, you can select any text then right click and select 'translate'.

### Language learning at UHH

At the University, you can take courses through the [Deutsch als Fremdsprache (German as a foreign language)](https://www.uni-hamburg.de/sprachenzentrum/daf.html).  These are offered in term time, normally in Von-Melle-Park (about a 10-minute walk from Bu53) or as intensive courses (2 weeks) before term starts.  An online test or previous certificate is required to set your level.

They will ask you to register in Stine (our online course management software) but if you are not registered as a student, this doesn't seem to be possible.  You can alternatively contact the organiser or the lecturer for the course you are interested, in order to be added.

### Language learning apps

Duolingo offers a quick way to get started (but not very fast to progress).

Busuu is a paid option which matches the typical courses (A1.1, A1.2, B2.1, B2.2).

### Other language learning options?

There are a lot of other places in Hamburg to take language classes. 
- Goethe Institut (more expensive, online or near Hauptbahnhof, intensive/evening/weekend courses)
- City run courses (inexpensive)
- UNS in Hoheluft (intensive courses)
- others?

## Hamburg Welcome Center

There is a lot of helpful information found at the [Hamburg Welcome Center](https://www.hamburg.com/welcome/hwc/) including webinars about taxes and schools.  A lot (but not all) information is available in English.

## School Information Center (Schulinformationszentrum)

The [school information center](https://welcome.hamburg.de/schule/4591016/siz/) is where you need to sign up to get your kids registered in school.  Normally, they will require your child's Meldebestatigung (registration certificate) which you receive at the end of your registration appointment (Anmeldung).

Note that school holidays in Germany are at all different times (intentionally, to reduce impact on transport).  Calendars can be found by googling "School holidays in Hamburg", e.g. [here](https://www.holidays-info.com/germany/school-holidays/hamburg/).

## University service for 'newly appointed'

The university has a service for newly appointed professors and their [website](https://www.kus.uni-hamburg.de/en/themen/berufungen/neuberufene/service.html) has a lot of useful information.

## Bike rentals (short and medium term)

- There is a local bike rental service in Hamburg called [Stadtrad](https://stadtrad.hamburg.de/en/home/).  You can download their app, sign up (small fee) and then use the app to check out bikes and check them back in at designated spots in the city. 
- For medium term (monthly) rental, [Swapfiets](https://swapfiets.de/hamburg) is an option.  For something like â‚¬23/mo you can rent a bike.  On first rental, you can either pick it up in Altona at their shop or ask for an appointment where they will bring it to you.
