 abstract={This data set provides quality controlled temperature, conductivity and pressure measurements from moored instrumentation (Seabird Microcat) in the Denmark Strait. Practical salinity was calculated from the measured quantities and is provided as well. Temporal resolution of the time series is 10 minutes. The data was collected from July 2007 to July 2008 at the location of mooring DS2. This mooring is part of the Denmark Strait Overflow array and maintained by the Institute of Oceanography, University Hamburg. The purpose of the array was to monitor the properties and variability of the dense Denmark Strait Overflow.},
