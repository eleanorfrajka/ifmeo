abstract = "<p>As part of the TERIFIC (Targeted Experiment to Reconcile 
Increased Freshwater with Increased Convection) project funded by the 
European Research Council, two Kongsberg Seagliders (sg602 and sg638) were 
deployed offshore of Qaqortoq, southwest of Greenland, in December 2019 
from the 30-m research vessel Adolf Jensen. Both gliders were retrieved in 
Trinity Bay on the Labrador coast of Canada in May 2020 from a fishing 
boat. Glider sg602 had a standard fairing and a standard hardware; glider 
sg638 had an ogive fairing and was equipped with a science controller. 
Unpumped CTDs (Conductivity, Temperature, and Depth), referred to as CT 
sails and provided by Sea-Bird Electronics (Bellevue, WA) were mounted on 
both Seagliders with a sampling frequency of 0.1 Hz. An Aanderaa oxygen 
optode was also fixed on both gliders but only sg638 returned measurements 
of dissolved oxygen concentration. Both gliders were equipped with WETLabs 
(Western Environmental Technologies Laboratories) BBFL2 ECO Puck that 
measures chlorophyll, colored dissolved organic matter and optical 
backscatter (700 nm). Initial processing with the University of 
Washington&rsquo;s basestation corrects for the thermal-inertia effect of 
the CT sail. Both gliders were processed with the GliderTools toolbox 
(Gregor et al., 2019) to determine adjusted temperature and salinity 
variables.</p>",
